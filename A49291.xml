            <p>Created by converting TCP files to TEI P5 using tcp2tei.xsl,
      TEI @ Oxford.

         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            </opener>
            <p>ALthough it is uſual yet not always ſo need<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful as in this
caſe, to uſher in the following matter with a preparatory Introduction to
prepare thee to conſider of what is here offered, which is not that which is
newly ſprung up in my under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding, but that which hath been my
ſtedfaſt be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lief and ſatisfied perſwaſion more then twenty years, as
many can witneſſe; and the truth is, thoſe prodigious hard favoured and
frightful noti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons and Opinions, which I often meet with, both in words and
writings, built upon this portion of <pb facs="tcp:107768:3"/>Scripture, has preſt me even
beyond my genius to appear in this way; for I am deeply ſenſible of my own
inabillity in parts and learning to anſwer the expectations of the knowing
Criticks of our age, neither ſhall make that my aim in my pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedings: that
which I deſigne in this Treatiſe is in a very plain and familiar way to
offer my Opinion and underſtanding to the unbia<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ſt Reader upon this portion of Scripture, as my
underſtanding has been rectified by the current of other Scriptures, and the
judgements of many approved and very learned men both antient and modern which
I have conſulted with: and although my genius has not at any time inclined me
to imbroyl my ſelf in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troverſies publique or private, but hath given my
ſelf to the ſtudy of thoſe more immediatly neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary doctrines in
Religion, yet I am greatly deſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous (ſo far as God ſhall enable me) to
be inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mental to make an eſſay, to diſpel thoſe clouds of
darkneſſe, that to many, do interpoſe between them and that truth
ſhining in this Scripture: and the more willingly do I concern my ſelf in
this mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, becauſe I judge the great name and gracious nature of our good
God is much diſparaged and obſcured by the more general conſtruction of
this portion of Scripture: the common and general re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving Opinion of men
upon this place of Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture (I ſay) doth not comport with that name that
God is known by elſewhere in the holy Scriptures, as to be a God <hi>good,
gracious, merciful, juſt, equal,</hi> not <hi>puniſhing the guiltleſſe,
nor quitting the guilty, but judging every man according to his works,</hi>
that <hi>takes no pleaſure in the deſtruction of the wicked;</hi> but is
<hi>long-ſuffering</hi> to us ward, not <hi>willing that any ſhould 
<pb facs="tcp:107768:3"/>periſh:</hi> whereas the common Opinion ſuppoſedly deduced
from this Chapter doth render God parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all in his dealings with the ſons of
men, whilſt they are in no capacity to act good or evil: I may be bold to
ſay, that there is no portion of Scripture in the whole book of God, more
wronged, wrack<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and tortured, ſubborned, and made to ſpeak what it never
meant as this is: This nineth of the <hi>Romans</hi> is made the ſupterfuge
of many dreadful amazing notions; as for inſtance.</p>
            <p>1. That all things happen not only according to Gods fore
knowledge but by his expreſſe decree, that <hi>Eſau</hi> was a wicked man
by vertue of Gods poſitive decree of Reprobation, before he was born; that
wicked men by ſtrong impulſes from God do that which is unlawful for them
to do; that Gods decrees are not leſſe efficacious in his permiſſion of
evil, then in the bringing forth of good: ſome have ventured to ſay, that
all ſin is of God, as the au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor; and man as the inſtrument: others
affirm, that there are two wills in God, a ſecret and a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vealed, and by
conſequence the one quite contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry to the other, as to the ſame act, the
one decree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing what the other forbids, which to me ſeems a greater piece of
abſurdity, then thoſe are guilty of who were of Opinion, that there are two
Gods, as the different authors of good and evil: But it is true, there are but
few who will be ſo bold, though of the forenamed Opinions in the root, to
make ſuch an ingenious application of their own Opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, as others have
done. But (Reader) give me leave to preſent thee with the ſtandard which I
de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire to meaſure by, to preſerve me from all thoſe extravagant
notions aforeſaid, which I hope may <pb facs="tcp:107768:4"/>not be offenſive to any to
cloſe with upon due con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſideration: and in order thereunto, know that I
deſire but two principles to be the ſquare and mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure of what I hold on
the contrary to the premi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes. 
<list>
                  <item>1. That all ſin is of man and not of God; that God doth
not tempt, much leſs force any man to ſin.</item>
                  <item> 2. That all good is of God, and not Originally of
man,</item>
               </list> and in both theſe principles I have the Apoſtle
<hi>James</hi> on my ſide; <hi>James</hi> 1. <hi>ver.</hi> 13. 17. God is the
author of all the good men do and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive: man is the author of all the evil
he commits, and of all the evil he ſuffers for his evil ſo com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mited; all
the good we do is by ſtrength received from God, not from any good
diſtinctly in himſelf: grace makes men able to do good, not unable to do
evil: God puniſheth no man with eternal death under the notion of a creature,
but as a malefa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctor; no man is ſinful becauſe he is ordained to
condemnation, but ordained to condemnation be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe he is ſinful,
<hi>Jude,</hi> 4. if any ſuppoſe two wills in God, with reſpect to mans
eternal ſtate, we muſt; yea it were prepoſterous to judge of his
re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vealed will by his ſuppoſed ſecret; but we muſt reſolve his
ſecret will into his revealed will, <hi>Deut.</hi> 29. <hi>laſt.</hi> Thus
far we may grant, that Gods an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tecedent will is, <hi>that all men ſhould be
ſaved,</hi> and his ſubſequent will, wherein he decrees the death of
rebellious rejecters of his grace: I hope it will eaſily be granted that
grace makes men able to chooſe good, not unable to refuſe it: It is a
ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of <hi>Tertullian, that as God made man in his own image ſo in
nothing more lively then in the freedome <pb facs="tcp:107768:4"/>and liberty of his will,
otherwiſe</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>he were neither liable to reward or
puniſhment, being under a neceſſity.</hi> I am ſenſible, that I am
upon a great diſadvantage in what I ſhall here offer, becauſe the far
greater number of zealous Profeſſors are ſo prepoſſeſt with ill
will to this doctrine, that they will hardly be willing to reade, much leſs
conſider of what is offered of this kinde: the zealous Jews were not more
prejudic't againſt our Saviour then many profeſſors are againſt this
doctrine: but know it is commendable and honourable for per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, to compare
what they reade and hear to the Scriptures, as the <hi>Bereans</hi> did, who
hereupon ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred themſelves more noble then thoſe of
<hi>Theſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lonica:</hi> Truth is ſo worthy a jewel, that wiſe
<hi>So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lomon</hi> doth counſel us, <hi>to buy it what ever it coſt,
Pro.</hi> 23. he hath ty'd us to no price in the purchaſe of it; and this
truth now in controverſie is of great concernment, rightly to underſtand
the terms of ſalvation: it is a dangerous thing to be yoked with errour,
eſpecially in a matter of ſuch great importance, about Gods decree, with
reſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect to mans eternal ſtate: it is an uncomfortable condition, for
perſons to live in doubt and queſtion of the reallity of Gods deſire of
their ſalvation, in the offers and tenders of his grace: and no opinion doth
more naturally and rationally leade perſons to ſpiritual
ſlothfulneſſe, to live in a doubt hereof, whether our labour will be
ſucceſſeful in the Lord: I was lately reading a ſaying of a learned
man, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpecting the Opinion that I am now oppoſing, as to the tendency of
it; and theſe are his words in ſubſtance, if not <hi>verbatim: If the God
of this world had a minde or opportunity to petition to the grandees 
<pb facs="tcp:107768:5"/>or pillers in Religion, met in councel, that they would take ſome
pitty on him, and eſtabliſh by law ſome few doctrins, which he ſhould
nominate for the relief of his tottering kingdome, this would be the firſt or
chief he would nominate, namely, the doctrine of abſolute perſonal and
irreſpective Election and Repro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bation: which doctrin is directly calculated
for the fleſh and old man: for</hi> (ſaith that Doctor) <hi>in effect a man
may be unjuſt, unmerciful, partial and full of diſſimulation, hating
moſt men without cauſe, and yet moſt like God himſef:</hi> Thus
ſpeaketh that Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor as to the import of this opinion.</p>
            <p>But it will appear from the following Expoſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, that our
Apoſtle had no affinity with ſuch an Opinion of ſuch <hi>Perſonal
Election,</hi> neither was ſuch an opinion any ways properly conducing to the
effecting his deſigne upon the unbelieving Jews; who reckoned themſelves
the elect of God, and none elſe in all the world; but the whole world
beſides were caſt off; and therefore they forbid the Apoſtles <hi>to
preach to the gentiles, that they might be ſaved:</hi> whereas the Apoſtles
deſigne was, to convince the Jews, that Gods elect were ſuch and ſuch
only, who ſhould believe in Jeſus Chriſt, as well gentiles as Jews, there
being no reſpect of perſons with God.</p>
            <p>The method which I ſhall proceed in, is that which is uſual in
Treatiſes of this nature.</p>
            <list>
               <item>I firſt enquire into the various readings of the
words.</item>
               <item> 2. Conſult the Original reading with them.</item>
               <item> 3. Give the ſcope ſence and meaning with an eye to the
Context.</item>
               <item> 
                  <pb facs="tcp:107768:5"/>4. Lay down thoſe doctrinal concluſions that
doth naturally flow from the words.</item>
            </list>
            <p>But I fear I ſhall hold the Reader too long in the Preface,
which to ſome may be unpleaſant, I ſhall therefore with a few
inſtructions to the Reader, break off, and refer him to the book it ſelf. 
<list>
                  <item>1. <hi>I</hi> entreat the Reader, that he would not judge
of the matter of this book, according to thoſe many imperfections in the
management of it, but according to that truth ſhining in the ſcope of the
whole; you have here a brief <hi>compendium</hi> of the whole controverſial
part of the Chapter, wherein you may as in a glaſſe ſee the face of the
whole at once.</item>
                  <item> 2. Know this, that there was a time when I was
pathetically engaged in my judgement on the other hand, till through reading
and ſearching the Scriptures, and reaſoning with thoſe differing from me
in the matter, the truth did forceably and convincingly ſhine into my
underſtanding; from whence I am inſtructed to wait not only with pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence,
and with charity, but hopes alſo, as towards thoſe, who now yet do oppoſe
this truth: My own experience inſtructing me that a perſon may have a good

up of a ſweet harmony <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>

this 9th and 3, 4, 10, 11, Chapters of this Epiſtle, and herein I am
perſwaded that if the Reader do but lay aſide prejudice, and obſerve
narrowly and heed carefully as he go a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long, he will receive great
ſatisfaction in the truth of what is ſpoken from each verſe diſtinctly,
by that joint conſent and argument, appearing in the whole, put together: for
although it is poſſible to wreſt and miſinterpret ſome ſingle
verſes or paſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges in Scripture, yet it is granted on all hands, that he
that takes in the whole ſcope of Epiſtle, Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, and Context, in what he
ſpeaks, is in the ready way to make an unerring Conſtruction of matters.
This 9th of the <hi>Romans</hi> has been much wronged for want of this
obſervation, by Inſitting upon ſome verſes, without heeding the ſcope
of the whole; it was, (to <hi>Solomon</hi>) a ſight of the true mother, which
would not have the Child divided: an honeſt Expoſitor will take the
ſcope, whether it makes for or againſt him; now if you ſhall ſo
obſerve me, and go along with me, I dare to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe <pb n="2" facs="tcp:107768:10"/>you
ample ſatisfaction, that there is no ſuch Doctrine concluded in this
context, as Irreſpective Election, or Reprobation of perſons.</p>
            <p>I proceed, it is granted on all hands, even by thoſe zealous on
the other hand, that the great de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigne that the Apoſtle carried on in this
Epiſtle and Chapter, is to aſſert and maintain juſtification and
eternal ſalvation to come in by faith alone, without the works of the law;
and that there is an abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lute neceſſity of believing in Jeſus
Chriſt, to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent eternal perdition, both by Jew and gentile: this is
poſitively determined, <hi>Cha.</hi> 2.8.9. <hi>tribula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and wrath upon
all that obey not the truth, upon the Jew firſt, and alſo upon the
gentile:</hi> there being no reſpect of perſons with God, the Jews muſt
come in at the ſame door with the gentiles.</p>
            <p>Now the Apoſtle being deeply ſenſible, that his brethren the
Jews lay under the danger of this great ſeverity, as they were Rejecters of
Chriſt and the Goſpel, he is cordially concerned for them, as appeareth by
his ſolemn proteſtation and aſſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration, as to the ſorrow of heart
that he lay under for them, <hi>vers.</hi> 1. and that which he knew was as a
ſtumbling-block in their way as to their believing in Jeſus Chriſt, was
their dependance upon their carnal priviledges which they were inveſted with,
as they were <hi>Abrahams</hi> ſeed according to the fleſh, which

<hi>Abrahams</hi> loins through <hi>Iſaac,</hi> in whom the promiſe was
lodged, might be hated, and his mountain deſtroyed; then how can you Jews,
though the ſeed of <hi>Abraham,</hi> in a remote ſenſe, claim from that

he ſaith not, <hi>to ſeeds,</hi> but <hi>ſeed,</hi> which ſeed is
Chriſt; and if the Jews ſhould further pleade, that beſide there
deſcent from <hi>Abrahams</hi> loins, they are a people near to God, in
covenant, by circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſion and the Ceremonial law, and thereby
diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſhed from all the nations of the world to be Gods people: the
Apoſtle follows them in that alſo, <hi>ver.</hi> 11. <hi>that the purpoſe
of God according to ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction ſhould ſtand, not of works,</hi> that is not
of works of that kinde, which was eminently typed out in the excluding
<hi>Iſhmael</hi> out of <hi>Abrahams</hi> family, and from the Inheritance:
for in ſo doing God did alſo exclude the works of the law from
juſtifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation, as we may ſee plainly <hi>Gal.</hi> 4.22,23,24. for
<hi>Iſaac</hi> and <hi>Iſhmael</hi> were two lively types of the two
Covenants, and that from <hi>Sinai</hi> is rejected as to Juſtification, ſo
that neither from their pedigree nor their legall obedience, could they have
any ſpecial acceptance with God, for <hi>by the works of the law ſhall no

            <p>Now hereupon the Jews proceeds to raiſe a 2d and new Objection,
formed thus, what doth not God Juſtifie according to works (<hi>Paul?</hi>)
then by this doctrine of thine thou ſeemeſt to contradict that declared
righteous Rule of Gods proceedings, which is to judge and reward every man
according to his works: this <hi>Obj.</hi> the Apoſtle ſuppoſeth and

of him that rnnneth, but of God that ſheweth Mercy,</hi> that is, <hi>not of

none can queſtion, to ſhew Mercy to whom, or upon what terms he pleaſe,
ſo alſo he hath the ſame liberty to inflict ſpiritual Judgements, yea,
judicially to harden whom or what ſort of ſinners he pleaſe; and to be
plain, (as if he ſhould have ſaid) God hath ſingled out above all
ſinners as the ſubjects of this his ſeverity, ſuch as ſhall abuſe
his long-ſuffering and goodneſſe, the firſt-born of which ſort of
ſinners was <hi>Pharaoh</hi> of old, who is brought as a type of ſuch in
all generations, both as to the nature of their ſin and deſtruction; and
therefore the Apoſtle brings that ſaying of God to <hi>Pharaoh, ver.</hi>

raiſed thee up, or dilive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red thee from ſo many deaths, and kept thee yet

think need not be queſtioned, and as the righteouſneſſe of God in his

leſſe denyed, no more can it be queſtioned in his dealings with the Jews,
who trod in his ſteps: Now from both theſe Inſtances drawn from Gods
ſayings to <hi>Moſes</hi> and <hi>Pharaoh,</hi> the Apoſtle draws up this

<hi>Peter</hi> 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 3.16. tells us, that in his beloved brother
<hi>Pauls</hi> Epiſtles their are ſome things hard to be underſtood,
which the <hi>unlearned or unskilful wreſt to their own deſtruction,</hi>
amongſt which things (or ſayings) this part of his writing this Chapter,
cannot be exempted but neceſſarily comprehended, eſpecially if we will
obſerve the context or verſe chieſſy before, 2 <hi>Peter</hi> 3.15. no
portion of Scripture ſeems in the judgment of moſt men to be attended with
greater difficulty, and many perſons takes occaſion from what is here
de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared to diſparadge and obſcure the univerſall and impartial love and
grace of God to Mankinde in Jeſus Chriſt: to prevent which miſtakes, it
will be altogether needfull in our reading this chapter to carry along in our
eye the main ſcope and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigne of the Apoſtle in what he here writes to
this people, which was in a direct line to prove his grand <hi>theſis,</hi>
namely, <hi>juſtification by faith without the deeds of the law:</hi> and
therein this Chapter car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries a compleat analogy with the former, and two
following Chapters of this Epi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>le,
the grand ſcope of all which is to convince the Jew of his ſin, in not 
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:107768:14"/>believing in Jeſus Chriſt for life and ſalvation.</p>
            <p>The Apoſtle in this Epiſtle and Chapter had an eye to the Jews
great Argument, with reſpect to the covenant made with <hi>Abraham,</hi>
which argument is by them formed thus: if not any be juſtified but by faith
in Chriſt, then the Jews (though the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural ſeed of <hi>Abraham</hi>) are
not juſtified, but are in the ſtate of condemnation, for they hate
Chriſt, have perſecuted and ſlayn him: but it is abſurd to conclude,
that the Jews are not juſtified, therefore man may be juſtifyed ſome
other way then by be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieving in Chriſt: and the <hi>Minor</hi> of this
argument is ſtrengthened by a three-fold fortification which the Jews think
impregnable.</p>
            <p> 
               <list>
                  <item>As firſt, ſay they, to the ſeed of <hi>Abraham</hi>
was the promiſe made, and if they be not juſtified, then there is a failing
in Gods word.</item>
                  <item> Secondly, there are not any amongſt all the ſons of
men ſo zealous for righteouſneſs, therefore they muſt needs be the
perſons juſtified.</item>
                  <item> Thirdly, ſay they, if they be not juſtified, then hath
God caſt off his own people which he hath choſen:</item>
               </list>But theſe things cannot be ſo, therefore this doctrine
of juſtification by faith in Chriſt muſt be a doctrine of <hi>Pauls</hi>
deviſing, and not the truth of God.</p>
            <p>Now, my ſouls deſire and prayer to God is, that the truth in
this Scripture might clearly ſhine into the hearts of all that are ſincere,
who ſhall reade the enſuing matter; and that which I deſigne as I go
along, ſhall be to diſcharge this Scripture from that hard ſervice which
it is preſt to ſerve in; which is, to atteſt a perſonal abſolute
Election and reprobation, unchangeable and irrevocable, eſtabliſht before
the foundation of the world; <pb n="11" facs="tcp:107768:14"/>which preordination of God
doth unavoydably ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſitate men to be what they are, and ſhall be, as
to ſin and death, Righteouſneſs and life; which in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference and

had here to do with a people, who partly through prejudice to the perſons and

againſt them for thoſe injuries done to him; and therefore he is
ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſitated to take great pains to raiſe and beget in them a credit of
his choyce love and affection to them, which he labours after, in the beginning
of this Chapter: theſe 5 firſt verſes contains the proem or preface to
the Chapter.</p>
            <p>In which preface, we have the Apoſtles moſt ardent and
patheticall complaint and manifeſtati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of ſorrow, in the behalf of he
Jews, his countrey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, who were not only ignorant, but perſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors of

a ſolemn and ſacred pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtation and profeſſion in theſe words:
<hi>I ſay the truth in Chriſt, I lye not:</hi> The certainty of this which
the Apoſtle ſpeaks, is two ways confirmed.

                     <item>Firſt, by his poſitive atteſtation, <hi>I ſay the

               </p>
               <p>Theſe words of our Apoſtle are read two ways: ſome reade
inſtead of <hi>in, by</hi> Chriſt, not as we reade here: as <hi>Paul</hi>
having an eye to Chriſt as a witneſs; as if he ſhould ſay; Chriſt
thou knoweſt that I ſay nothing but truth, that my ſorrow is real, and
ſo alſo doth my conſcience bear witneſs, and ſo doth the ſpirit of
God alſo in this matter; and that this is the dialect of the Apoſtle, ſee
elſewhere, <hi>Gal.</hi> 1.10. <hi>now the things which I write unto you,
behold, before God I lye not:</hi> ſo alſo 2 <hi>Corinth.</hi> 11.31.
<hi>the God and father of our Lord Jeſus Chriſt knoweth that I lye
not:</hi> I appeal to him that I lye not, as here.</p>
               <p>But 2dly, the moſt both of antient and latter In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpreters
underſtands and reades theſe words of the Apoſtle otherways, as
containing in them the nature and force of an oath, becauſe the particle
tranſlated <hi>in,</hi> (ſay they) may be more properly tranſlated
<hi>by;</hi> and ſo ſaith <hi>Calvin, Piſcator</hi> and
<hi>Muſculus,</hi> and ſo they reade thoſe words, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 12.1.
<hi>I knew a man by Chriſt;</hi> and of the ſame minde are moſt of our
latter writers, who alſo takes theſe <pb n="14" facs="tcp:107768:16"/>words as an
aſſeveration or an oath, but take it ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther way, they carry in them a very
pathetical at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtation, that what the Apoſtle ſpeaks concerning his
ſorrow for the Jews, was a real truth.</p>
               <p>Secondly, It is farther ratified from his duplicati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on in the
negative <hi>(I lye not;)</hi> had it not been e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough for the Apoſtle, that
he had poſitively affir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med it, and called God to witneſs, that he had
ſaid the truth.</p>
               <p>I anſwer, that it was uſual amongſt the Jews, when they
ſpeak earneſtly, and with the greateſt confidence, and in things
conſiderable thus to dou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble their ſpeech: as for inſtance; in that
Meſſage to <hi>Hezekiah, Eſa.</hi> 38. <hi>thou ſhalt dye and not

<hi>John</hi> 20. <hi>confeſſed and denyed not;</hi> and this kinde of
ſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing was uſual: ſee what pains the Apoſtle takes to perſwade the
Jews into as good Opinion of his love to them as a good Introduction to what he
had to ſay to them: from whence I note by the way. 
<q>1. Doctrine, <hi>That it is a matter of great con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cernment, in
order to a right Receiving what is offer'd by a Goſpel-Miniſter: that the
people be ſatisfyed, that what be ſays, he ſpeeks from the root of tender
love and pitty to their ſouls.</hi>
                  </q>
               </p>
               <p>The Apoſtle did not think it loſt labour in him to effect
this end, by this means, before us; and the like pains he takes elſewhere:
ſee 2 <hi>Corinth.</hi> 7.3. <hi>you are in our hearts to live and dye with
you:</hi> 2 <hi>Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rinth.</hi> 11.11. <hi>God knows I love you: Philip.</hi>
1.8. <hi>God is my Record, how greatly I long after you, in the Bowels of
Chriſt;</hi> ſee what pains he takes to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwade the Churches into a
belief of his love to them: <hi>Paul</hi> takes pains alſo with the Jews to
per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwade them, that this ſorrow was the effect of his <pb n="15" facs="tcp:107768:16"/>to them; which to do he could appeal to his own conſcience; he was
always careful to make con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience to his Friend: ſee <hi>Acts.</hi> 24.16.
2 <hi>Corinth.</hi> 1.12. therein <hi>was his rejoycing,</hi> and he knew the
holy ſpirit ſtir'd him up to ſpeak that he ſpake: I might again note by
the way. 
<q>2. Doctrine, <hi>That it is warrantable in a
Goſpel-Miniſter, in matters of concernment, where we doubt of being
believed in things of God, to confirm what we ſay by obliging atteſtations
and proteſtations, when we have in ſo doing a good conſcience:</hi> I
have ſhown this before, <hi>Gal.</hi> 1.20. 2 <hi>Corinth.</hi> 11.31.
<hi>Phil.</hi> 18.</q>
               </p>

evil:</hi> to which I anſwer.

                     <item>1ſt, That Chriſts deſigne in theſe words could
not intend to oblige perſons to theſe ſyllabicall words of <hi>yea</hi>
and <hi>nay.</hi>
                     </item>
                     <item> 2ly, Neither do they oblige us as to Number, that we
muſt multiply no more, by way of atteſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, for we muſt not imagine,
that Chriſt would contradict his words in his own practice;</item>
                  </list> was not Chriſts <hi>verily, verily,</hi> more then,
<hi>yea</hi> and <hi>nay;</hi> and the Apoſtle did not underſtand our Lord
ſo, as you may ſee before, but Chriſt in this place deſignes to take
off the Jews from their voluntary vain oaths and atteſtations in their
Communications one with another; as in <hi>Jephthas</hi> caſe, and many
others: and to the ſame end tends the Apoſtle <hi>James</hi>'s words,
<hi>Chap.</hi> 5. if Chriſts deſigne had been to for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bid all kinde of
ſwearing, there needed not to be an enumeration made, of what they ſhould
not ſwear by; neither can ſwearing in a ſolemn way in the fear of God be

                  </gap>d particular to

Apoſtle for the Jews; the Apoſtle is not ſatisfyed only to aſſert the
truth of his ſorrow, but the nature and degree of it, which as the learned
tell us, is ſet forth in 3 circumſtances, to be very great, therefore
(ſay they) this word tranſlated <hi>ſorrow</hi> doth ſignify the
<hi>ſorrow of a woman</hi> in travel, uſed <hi>John</hi> 16.21. <hi>you now
have ſorrow:</hi> and the Apoſtle to the <hi>Galathians,</hi> tells them,
that <hi>he was in travel for them, cha.</hi> 4.19.</p>
               <p>2ly, This ſorrow is ſet forth by the ſucceſſive
continuance of it, it is ſaid here to be continually like the pains of a
woman, one throw after ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, night and day: It was not a tranſient
ſorrow but a ſeizing and laſting ſorrow.</p>
               <p>Therefore in the third place, the greatneſſe is ſet forth
by the ſeat of it, which is, the heart, ſharp and deep: when the Scriptures
ſpeak of <hi>ſorrow of heart and ſoul</hi> it intends ſharp &amp;
exquiſite ſorrow; ſaith our Lord, <hi>my ſoul is ſorrowful unto
death:</hi> my ſorrow is very great and deep.</p>

this ſorrow, which is not ſo fully expreſt as it is to be underſtood in

will not ſerve him to expreſs in particulars the cauſe he ſaw for this
ſorrow: great grief ſometime ſilenceth a man from giving the particulars

conſequently that he was not their ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my but their cordial Friend.</p>
               <p>2dly, Herein is not only manifeſted his love to them; but the

to the end they might be reduc't from their unbelief and diſobedience: the
Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle ſeems to wiſh himſelf in a ſtate of damnation to bring them
unto a ſtate of ſalvation: Oh how great was this love of <hi>Paul?</hi> it
did bear to a degree a reſemblance to the love of God and Chriſt, both as
to the greatneſſe of the love <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

even to enemies: <hi>Rom.</hi> 5. he is wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling to be Anathamized for his

reade <hi>Acts</hi> the 33.13. about forty Jews layd wait for <hi>Paul</hi> to
kill him.</p>
               <p>But to come more cloſer to the words, and more ſtrictly to
enquire what is wrapt up in this his wiſh: Interpreters are much divided
about this matter in their Opinions, and many of them very extravagant in their
opinions, which I ſhall not meddle with: ſome there are, that the Apoſtle
ſpeaks not here as he really did mean, but parab<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

properly and preciſely to be underſtood; and that there is no more to be
underſtood in it then this, that he could ſuffer a great deal for their
good.</p>
               <p>Secondly, Others think that he muſt be under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood only
conditionally in this his wiſh, if it could be, or were poſſible, as he
ſpeaks of the <hi>Galathi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans,</hi> they would have pulled out their own
eyes, and have given them to him, if it had been poſſible, ſo if it were
poſſible, <hi>I could wiſh my ſelf accurſed<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

do not ſuite with the ſolemneſs of the Apoſtles atteſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and
aſſeveration going before; to the truth and reallity of which his ſpeech,
he calls Chriſt's con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience and ſpirit to bear witneſſe.</p>
               <p>There are but three Interpretations worth our taking notice of,

is, the body of Chriſt; and our laſt expoſitors do ſo ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der it, and

follow their <hi>anathama:</hi> they were delivered up to Sathan, they were

wiſh my ſelf the veryeſt abject and object of ſhame and ſpite; let me
be as thus expoſed to the worſt of ruines, yea, the moſt curſed death

Scriptures; not that this <hi>anathama</hi> muſt intend the vengance of

                  <p>4th Priviledge, the Covenants were given and made to them:
theſe were the people that God en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred into Covenant with in ſpecial;

                  <p>I anſwer, there are two ſorts of Covenants, one
conditional, the other free; that <hi>Geneſis</hi> 9. is a Covenant without a
condition, and it may be called a free promiſe on Gods ſide voluntarily,
but a Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant properly underſtood ſuppoſeth a mutual contract between
two; and in this ſort God made his Covenant with them: <hi>Geneſis</hi>
17.</p>
                  <p>2ly, No people had the covenant renewed as they had from time
to time, and therefore we <pb n="29" facs="tcp:107768:23"/>have it here in the plural,
<hi>Covenants; Iſrael</hi> was ſingularly dignified above other nations,
yet this is not to be underſtood excluſively, but chiefly and eminently:
<hi>Iſrael</hi> had the Covenants, that is, they were Feoffees in truſt, as

<q>Firſt Doctrine, <hi>That the body of the Circumciſed

exalted, dignified and diſtinguiſhed; with very great priviledges above all
the world be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides, they were beloved for their fathers ſakes.</hi>

Or thus, <hi>that believing in, accepting of, and obeying Jeſus Chriſt, is

in this Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pter, which matter calls for our moſt ſerious con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſideration,
to the end we might attain to the true intent and meaning of the ſpirit
therein.</p>
               <p>It appeareth upon the firſt caſt of our eye up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on this
Scripture, that the Apoſtle had in good earneſt to do with a ſtout and
ſtrong adverſary, with whom he is joyning iſſue, and that with all his
might; and this enemy was the zealous cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumciſed Jew, boaſting of his
carnal priviledges, and expecting juſtification and ſalvation by the deeds
of the law, in oppoſition to Chriſt and the Goſpel: they being (as they
preſumed) the ſeed of thoſe to whom the promiſes were by God at firſt
made; and hereupon their confidence was raiſed very high of their ſafe
eſtate. Now to ſuch a people doth the Apoſtle here addreſſe
himſelf. And his great deſigne (as we may clearly ſee) is to aſſert
Juſtification and ſalvation to come in only and alone by faith in Jeſus
Chriſt without the deeds of the law.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="36" facs="tcp:107768:27"/>Now the courſe and Method which the
Apoſtle proceeds in is this; Firſt, to weaken and diſſolve their grand
objections, and take off thoſe abſurdi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties which ſeemed to the Jews to
follow upon the Apoſtles Doctrine of Juſtification by faith alone.</p>
               <p>Thoſe two Objections which he knew lay in their mindes were
theſe. 
<list>
                     <item>1. If the circumciſed Jews be not Juſtified and
ſaved unto whoſe fathers God had made ſuch a plain promiſe, and renewed
from day to day, and from time to time, then it renders God not ſo good as
his word, then his word is of none effect: But it is abſurd to imagine Gods
word to be fallible: <hi>his promiſes are yea and amen;</hi> therefore the
circumſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed <hi>Iſrael</hi> muſt be Juſtifyed and ſaved, though
they do reject Jeſus Chriſt and the Goſpel: this is the ſum of the
firſt Argument and Objection.</item>
                     <item> The 2d Objection is this: If God juſtifyeth the
heathen, the nations, ſinners of the Gentiles, that are ſtrangers to God,
and that without works of legal righteouſneſſe, and reject us who are
com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paratively a righteous people, walking in his ways living in his
Ordinances, and worſhiping him; then doth the ways and proceedings of God
ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour of unrighteouſneſſe, and ſeems to bear a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſemblance of
juſtifying the unrighteous, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demning the righteous; which as
<hi>Abraham</hi> ſaid of old, is very far from God: therefore it muſt needs
be the ſeed of <hi>Abraham,</hi> that are the ſubjects of juſtification
and acceptance with God.</item>
                  </list>Now that this muſt needs be the ſubſtance, will
appear from thoſe anſwers which the Apoſtle ſhapes out to them in the
following verſes: and the taking off the firſt of theſe Objections, takes
him up the 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13. verſes: and the taking off 
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:107768:27"/>the ſecond Objection, takes him up the greateſt part of
the <hi>chapt.</hi> from the 14. <hi>ver.</hi> forwards.</p>
               <p>As to the firſt of theſe Objections, the Apoſtles
conceſs with them, that Gods word cannot fayl, his promiſes are yea and
amen, <hi>vers.</hi> 6. not as though the word of God had taken none effect;
Gods word and promiſes are certain and true, and yet you may be rejected;
which to demonſtrate he proceeds to diſtinguiſh of the ſeed of
<hi>Abraham,</hi> and to ſhew, that God in his ſpecial promiſe to
<hi>Abraham,</hi> did not intend the natural and fleſhly ſeed of
<hi>Abraham,</hi> but ſuch as ſhall be of the faith of <hi>Abraham:</hi>
this the Apoſtle ſpeaks largely unto <hi>ver.</hi> 6 to the 9. and to back
and confirm this poſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, that God did not intend <hi>Abrahams</hi> ſeed
accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the fleſh, the Apoſtle doth deſcend to ſome inſtances
of ſome perſons within the compaſſe of their grant, who though they
were the ſeed of <hi>Abraham,</hi> yet were not heirs of the promiſe: the
firſt Inſtance is of <hi>Iſhmael,</hi> who though a child of
<hi>Abraham,</hi> yet was by Gods appointment caſt out of the family, and
diſinherited from a ſhare with <hi>Iſaac;</hi> and whereas they might
readily pleade he was caſt out, partly becauſe he was the ſon of the
bondwoman, and partly for miſdemenour, becauſe he was ſeen mocking
<hi>Iſaac,</hi> the Apoſtle proceeds to give an inſtance without
exceptions; which is <hi>Eſau,</hi> who was the immediate Off-ſpring of
<hi>Iſaac,</hi> in whom the promiſe did more eſpecially center, yet he is
hated and comparatively ruina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, which things we have treated on to
<hi>ver.</hi> 13. all which tends to ſtrengthen the Apoſtles diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction
that <hi>Abrabams</hi> ſeed was not intended the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural or fleſhly
ſeed, but the ſeed according to ſaith: to which the Apoſtle to the
<hi>Galathians; <pb n="38" facs="tcp:107768:28"/>chap.</hi> 3.29. doth fully ſpeak; <hi>if
ye be Chriſts, then are you</hi> Abrahams <hi>ſeed, and heirs according to
pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe:</hi> So that if <hi>Eſau</hi> be not an heir, it is becauſe he
is not Chriſts by faith and obedience: ſo that that ſeed of
<hi>Abraham</hi> who are the elect ſeed, are ſuch as own and believe in
Chriſt; therefore if the Jews though the natural ſeed of <hi>Abraham,</hi>
do re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject Jeſus Chriſt, Gods word of promiſe ſtands good and
ſtedfaſt, although the unbelieving Jews are rejected: But I ſhall ſpeak
more particularly to each verſe and begin at the 6 verſe.</p>
               <p>And the Method which I ſhall follow in the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecution of
this work, is this. 
<list>
                     <item>1. To ſhew the deſigne, drift and ſcope of the text
and context.</item>
                     <item> 2. To open thoſe words that may ſeem difficult and
want explaining.</item>
                     <item> 3. Reduce the whole into ſuch doctrinal con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluſions
as may be moſt proper and profitable, and all this with as much
conciſeneſſe as the matter will admit.</item>
                  </list>
               </p>
               <p>I ſhall at once caſt my eye upon 3. or 4. <hi>verſes,</hi>
as to their main ſcope and tendency.</p>
               <p>As 1ſt, I ſhall take notice of thoſe <hi>verſes</hi> in
which the Apoſtles work is to manage his diſtincti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of <hi>Abrahams</hi>
ſeed, <hi>ver.</hi> 6. 7. 8. 9.</p>
               <p>I begin with <hi>ver.</hi> the 6. in which the Apoſtles
de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigne is, to aſſert the ſtedfaſtneſſe of Gods word of
promiſe made to <hi>Abraham,</hi> notwithſtanding his rejecting the carnal
unbelieving Jew, as not the right ſeed.</p>
               <p>Therefore the Apoſtle in the 1ſt place doth diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claim the
leaſt whiſperous ſecret imagination of minde that Gods word or promiſe
ſhould be liable to fail: Theſe words are read three ways.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="39" facs="tcp:107768:28"/>1ſt, It cannot be that the word of God
hath fai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led. Others reade, it is not poſſible that the word of God
ſhould miſcarry: Others reade, but not that the word of God is
fruſtrated: there is no ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terial difference in theſe readings, they all
amount to thus much: to atteſt the ſtedfaſtneſſe and cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainty of
Gods promiſes to thoſe to whom they are made: By <hi>word</hi> we are
generally to underſtand the word of promiſe; ſee <hi>Pſal.</hi> 106.24
and 119.38.</p>
               <p>I ſhall only note two points by the way, and ſo paſſe. 
<q>Firſt Doctrine, <hi>That ſometimes ſome paſſages of
Gods providences doth ſeem to croſse his promiſes.</hi>
                  </q>
               </p>
               <p>This paſſage ſeems to give occaſion to queſtion
whether the word of God had not failed; and thus it ſeemed in that
paſſage of <hi>Abrahams</hi> offering up of <hi>Iſaac,</hi> as alſo in
Gods carrying <hi>Iſrael</hi> into <hi>Egypt,</hi> ſo alſo in the death
of Jeſus Chriſt, <hi>John</hi> 12.34. that Chriſt ſhould abide for ever
ſeemed to be the promiſe: ſo in this paſſage before us, it ſeem'd
as if God had caſt off his people; <hi>Rom.</hi> 11.1. the Phraſes and
ſayings of Scripture ſeems to be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradictory many times, that ſuch as
are inconſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate men may be in danger to wreſt them to their own
deſtruction 2 <hi>Peter.</hi> 3.16.</p>
               <q>But Secondly, <hi>That however circumſtances may ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear to
us, it is ſafe to conclude, that Gods word and promiſe rightly underſtood
are certain and unfailable.</hi>
               </q>
               <p>And that Opinion or ſaying whatſoever which carries in it a
queſtion of the truth of Gods promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes <pb n="40" facs="tcp:107768:29"/>is in it ſelf
falſe and unſound: we ſee here what pains the apoſtle takes to deliver
himſelf from the leaſt imputation of his interfering with Gods pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes:
in what he had been aſſerting in the former two verſes, as to the
priviledges and promiſes to this people; the Apoſtle would have God true
though all men are lyers: ſee what he ſaith, <hi>Rom.</hi> 4.16. the
promiſes are ſure to all the ſeed, 2 <hi>Corinth.</hi> 1.20. <hi>all the
promiſes are in Chriſt yea and amen; for he is a God that cannot lye,
Titus.</hi> 1. Gods <hi>Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſels</hi> are by the ſame Apoſtle ſaid to
be immutable.</p>
               <p>Now the Apoſtle in vindication of the ſtedfaſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and
immutability of Gods promiſes to <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham</hi> takes it for granted, that
<hi>Abraham</hi> had two ſorts of ſeed; a ſeed according to the fleſh,
and a ſeed according to promiſe, but the ſeed according to the fleſh
was not the ſeed to whom the promiſe was made at firſt: <hi>for</hi>
(ſaith he) <hi>all are not</hi> Iſrael <hi>which are of Iſrael;</hi> but
how is this to be under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood? did he not ſay before, they were
<hi>Iſrael,</hi> it's without exception? I anſwer, ſo he doth alſo
here, own them to be of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> but they were not <hi>Iſrael</hi>
themſelves; they had not <hi>Abrahams</hi> nor <hi>Jacobs</hi> ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit; as
Chriſt told the Jews, <hi>John</hi> the 8th. though he grant them to be
<hi>Abrahams</hi> ſeed, yet they had not the ſpirit of <hi>Abraham;</hi>
inaſmuch as they ſought to kill him, and ſo manifeſt themſelves to be
of their father the devil, though of <hi>Abrahams</hi> ſeed: ſo theſe are
not <hi>Iſrael,</hi> becauſe they rejected Gods way by Chriſt.</p>
               <p>I ſhall note one point by the way, and paſs. 
<q>Doct. <hi>That true heirſhip to Gods ſingular promiſes
comes in by a ſupernatural way, by a ſpiritual birth: and not by common
generation.</hi>
                  </q>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="41" facs="tcp:107768:29"/>Perſons were never in no age born heirs of
ſingu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar and ſpeciall glory; it is not an Iſraelite but an Iſraelite
indeed, that is worthy of ſpecial noting by Chriſt: <hi>John</hi> 1.
ſaith Chriſt of <hi>Nathanael, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold an Iſraelite indeed, in whom is no
guile,</hi> there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore let none expect heirſhip or acceptance from God from
carnal or birth-priviledges, of moſt godly parents: and this is farther
ratified <hi>vers.</hi> the 7th, <hi>neither becauſe they are the ſeed
of</hi> Abraham <hi>are they all children,</hi> that is, Children of God they
are not.</p>
               <q>Doct. from the 7th, <hi>vers. The true ſeed of
<hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham,</hi> in all ages are ſuch as bears reſemblance to
<hi>Abraham</hi> in faith and love.</hi>
               </q>
               <p>It is frequent in Scripture to reckon perſons the Children of
thoſe whom they reſemble in good or evill; ſome of theſe
<hi>Iſraelites</hi> are the Children of the <hi>Ammonites</hi> and the
<hi>Hittites, Ezek.</hi> 16. ſome of them Children of the Adulterer and the
whore, <hi>Eſa.</hi> 57.30. yet <hi>Abrahams</hi> ſeed in a large fence:
nay ſome of theſe very Jews, <hi>Iohn</hi> 8.44. are the children of the
Devil; and why? but becauſe they reſembled the Devil in their lying and
murthering: ſo the women 1 <hi>Peter</hi> 3.6. <hi>are children of
Sarah,</hi> who carry it as ſhe did: <hi>Gal.</hi> 3.29. <hi>if ye be
Chriſts then are you</hi> Abrahams <hi>ſeed,</hi> but theſe did not

               </p>
               <p>But he adds, <hi>in</hi> Iſaac <hi>ſhall thy ſeed be
called,</hi> I ſhall ſpeak but a very few words to this clauſe in this
place, becauſe I ſhall have a more proper oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion afterwards.</p>
               <p>The occaſion of theſe words was this, <hi>Sarah</hi> tak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing

agree, <hi>Such as are Chriſts, are the ſeed and heirs according to the

Doctrine. 
<q>Doct. <hi>That the true ſeed of <hi>Abraham</hi> are not,

accept of any out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſide profeſſors ſince the beginning; but as he was a
ſearcher of hearts allways, ſo he allways required heart and
inſide-worſhip: he did always require to be worſhipped with heart,
ſoul, and ſtrength. In <hi>Abels</hi> time <hi>Cain</hi> was a worſhiper
as well as <hi>Abel,</hi> but the difference lay in the inſide of the
worſhip, therefore it is ſaid, <hi>Heb.</hi> 11.4. <hi>by faith</hi> Abel
<hi>offered to God a more acceptable ſacrifice then</hi> Cain.</p>
               <p>In the time of Circumciſion God was not ſatisfy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with a

<hi>Iſrael</hi> for the want hereof, <hi>Ierem.</hi> 9. Inward ſpiritual
worſhip was always required, and much more in Goſpel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>days: therefore
Chriſt tells the Jews, <hi>John,</hi> 6.53. <hi>Except you eat the fleſh of
the ſon of man, and drink his blood, ye have no life in you, Rom.</hi> 2.28.
he is not a Jew who is ſuch outwardly; God almighty was ſo cautious and
careful, leſt men ſhould bear upon works for Juſtification and acceptance
with him thereupon, that he declares <hi>Abraham</hi> juſtified before he was
circumciſed; and that our Apoſtle takes ſpecial notice of, <hi>Rom.</hi>
4.11. <hi>Abraham re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived circumciſion;</hi> a ſeal of the

if you are truly regenerated perſons and are begotten from above, do not
eaſily let go that hold; it is the duty of a child to grieve that he hath
offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded his loving father? but not to call in queſtion his relation to him
thereupon: God doth not un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>childe for every fault, nor for many ſins, if they
be not wilfully committed: but I pray miſtake me not, I would not have Gods
children paſſe lightly over their miſcarriages againſt him, nor their
unanſwerable returns to him, but mourn cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dially as <hi>David</hi> and
<hi>Peter</hi> did, not in ſlaviſh but filial frame of ſpirit: but know
this, that our ſanctification is not the ground of our juſtification, but
the Demonſtration of it: good works may de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monſtrate our
juſtification.</p>
               <p>2. Let each of us be inſtructed from hence, to have a
ſpecial care that we do not bear or reſt up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on our Goſpel-obedience for
acceptance or juſtifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation, namely, our Baptiſm, nor other
goſpel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>obedience in ordinances: for this we may be aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red 
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:107768:33"/>of as a truth, that if legal performances of God<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap> appointment were not accepted, being
only out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward, much leſs are goſpel perſormances in ordinan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
acceptable without the ſpiritual part of them: Baptiſm hath an inſide as
well as circumciſion, which conſiſts in two parts: death to ſin, life
to righteouſneſs: now if we have not this inſide, we are in a ſence
children of the fleſh, and ſo not the children of God: therefore S.
<hi>Peter</hi> takes both parts, 1 <hi>Peter</hi> 3. <hi>not the putting away
the filth of the fleſh, but the anſwer of a good conſcience;</hi> ſo
doth Chriſt, <hi>John</hi> 3. a true baptized Diſciple of Chriſt, is one
in whom Chriſt dwels by faith, <hi>Eph.</hi> 3.17. the Ordinance of the Lords
ſupper hath an inſide, a ſpiritual part: our hearts are to be fed as well
as our bodies: we are (as Chriſt ſaith) <hi>to eat his fleſh and drink
his blood,</hi> or elſe <hi>we have no life in us:</hi> it is the ſpiritual
part attending the outward that ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders a perſon acceptable to God: for he
ſeeks ſuch, eſpecially now, who <hi>worſhip him in ſpirit and
truth,</hi> John 4.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Abraham</hi> did much in going out of his countrey, and
offering up his ſon, yet his juſtification came in by his faith:
<hi>Rom.</hi> 3. it is true, his works did manifeſt the life and truth of his
faith, <hi>Iames</hi> 2. but it is ſaid, <hi>Abraham believed God, and it was
counted to him for righteouſneſs.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>3. If the children of the fleſh or law, be not the children of
God, then certain it is, that the chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren of faith are; and ſo thou who art
a Gentile-believer, art one of them: it may be much encou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ragement to a poor
goſpel-believer; it appears thou wert one of thoſe whom God had upon his
heart in his promiſe to <hi>Abraham</hi> at firſt: the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe made to
<hi>Abraham,</hi> that he ſhould be heir of <pb n="49" facs="tcp:107768:33"/>the world,
was made upon goſpel-terms not fleſhly, <hi>Rom.</hi> 4.13. <hi>If you are
believers in Chriſt, you are the proper heirs of that promiſe with
him,</hi> and ſo the moſt proper children of God, though thou art a
Gentile: ſo was <hi>Zacheus;</hi> yet upon his believing he is pronounc't a
child of <hi>Abraham</hi> by Jeſus Chriſt himſelf, <hi>Luke,</hi> 19.9.
It is the judgment of ſome learned men that <hi>Abrahams</hi> children may be
di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided into four ranks, or are of four ſorts. 
<list>
                     <item>1. Such as were his natural children according to a
fleſhly race, who were no ſharers in the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe, ſuch were
<hi>Iſhmael</hi> and <hi>Eſau.</hi>
                     </item>
                     <item> 2. Some who were deſcended of <hi>Ahrahams</hi> loins,
and were heirs of thoſe temporal promiſes of <hi>Canaan,</hi> and ſuch
like, ſuch were the fleſhly poſterity of <hi>Iſaac</hi> and
<hi>Jacob.</hi>
                     </item>
                     <item> 3. Such as deſcended of <hi>Abrahams</hi> loins
accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the fleſh, and not only ſo, but ſuch as were truly godly,
and had the faith of <hi>Abraham,</hi> even faith in Chriſt, as
<hi>Abraham</hi> had.</item>
                     <item> 4. Such as are not of the fleſhly ſeed of
<hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hams</hi> loins at all, but were only believers: of which ſort are
all the believing gentiles,</item>
                  </list>and theſe two latter ſorts may be reckoned into and
are the chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren of the promiſe, which leads us to ſpeak unto the
affirmitive part of this interpretation; <hi>But the children of the promiſe
are accounted for the ſeed.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>In handling this head, I ſhall caſt my eye to the verſe
before and verſe following, <hi>ver.</hi> 7. <hi>ver.</hi> 9. <hi>In</hi>
Iſaac <hi>ſhall thy ſeed be called,</hi> which ſaying is taken out of
<hi>Gen.</hi> 21.14. and the occaſion we may there ſee in the former part
of the chapter, which was this (as I minded before:) after <hi>Iſaac</hi> was
born and grown to ſome years, <hi>Sarah</hi> his mother takes no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice of
<hi>Iſhmael</hi> the bond-womans ſon, offering ſome <pb n="50" facs="tcp:107768:34"/>abuſe to her ſon <hi>Iſaac</hi> in mocking him; ſhe is
ſore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly diſpleaſed thereat, and beſought her husband to caſt both
ſon and mother out of doors, but <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham</hi> having love to his ſon,
it ſeemed grevious to him, to put her requeſt in execution; but ſoon
after God himſelf ſpeaks to him, and bids him hearken to his wife in this
matter, and put the ſon and mother both out of doors, and he gives
<hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham</hi> this as an argument, that <hi>Iſhmael</hi> ſhould not
inherit with <hi>Iſaac, but in</hi> Iſaac <hi>his ſeed ſhould be
cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led:</hi> that <hi>Iſaac</hi> ſhould be the heir alone without
<hi>Iſhmael:</hi> now <hi>Abraham</hi> having received this com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand from
God, proceeds accordingly, <hi>ver.</hi> 14. <hi>Abraham aroſe early in the
morning</hi> to perform that ſervice which was too grievous to him in
himſelf: it is worthy our noting.</p>
               <p>By the way note this Doctrine. 
<q> 
                     <hi>That our father <hi>Abraham</hi> was of a tractable frame
of ſpirit to Gods will, though in things croſſe and contrary to his own
will and intereſt: Abraham</hi> is not only willing to do it but he
riſeth early to do it.</q>
               </p>
               <p>This he did alſo in the offering up <hi>Iſaac, chap.</hi>
22. his dear and only ſon, he did ariſe early to go about it; this was the
ſpirit of our father <hi>Abraham</hi> whoſe ſteps we are to follow,
<hi>Rom.</hi> 5.12. in order to bleſſing <hi>Abraham,</hi> God called him
to his foot, <hi>Eſa.</hi> 41.2.</p>
               <p>Let us learn this leſſon from it, be like <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham</hi>
herein, it was kindely taken at his hand: God reckons him his friend,
<hi>James</hi> 2.23. and this pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viledge is promiſed, <hi>John.</hi> 15.14.
<hi>Ye are my friends when ye do whatſoever I command you:</hi> if thou
beeſt <pb n="51" facs="tcp:107768:34"/>a believer thou muſt look to <hi>Abraham</hi> thy
father, <hi>Eſa.</hi> 51. but I only touch this by the way, and now come to
the words <hi>ver.</hi> 7. <hi>In</hi> Iſaac <hi>ſhall thy ſeed be
called.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>It is not here to be underſtood, that all that come of
<hi>Iſaacs</hi> loins acording to the fleſh are here meant, for we know
<hi>Eſau</hi> came of <hi>Iſaac,</hi> but <hi>Iſaac</hi> is here
exhibited as a type of the true ſeed; they muſt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſemble
<hi>Iſaac</hi> in this birth: but I ſhall meet with this in the
interpretation as it followeth: <hi>the chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren of the promiſe are
accounted for the ſeed.</hi> I have already ſpoken ſomething to the
explaining theſe words, <hi>who are theſe children of promiſe:</hi> in
gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral, they are ſuch as are begotten by the promiſe through Chriſt;
but I would ſpeak more particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly a few words.</p>
               <p> 
                  <list>
                     <item>1. It is to be noted, that the Apoſtle doth not here
ſay, <hi>the children of promiſe,</hi> with reſpect to <hi>Iſaac</hi>
alone perſonally conſidered: but the Apoſtle had an eye to a race or
generation of men ſo quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied, that is to ſay, ſuch as reſemble
<hi>Iſaac,</hi> as to his extraordinary birth, and the extraordinary
in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpoſer of Gods power: therefore he ſaith in ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial, <hi>the
children of the promiſe:</hi> it is undeniably plain, that if the Apoſtles
deſigne had been here to lift up <hi>Iſaac</hi> as a type of abſolut
perſonal election, honeeded not to have proceeded this way as he doth, to
compute <hi>Abrahams</hi> ſeed by <hi>Iſaac,</hi> and by him in ſuch a
way: but if the Apoſtles deſigne was to render <hi>Iſaac</hi> as a type
of ſuch a ſort of per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, ſo qualified, then the whole context will
concurr with it.</item>
                     <item> 2. Whereas the Apoſtle here ſtileth theſe
per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons acceptable with God, <hi>children of the promiſe,</hi> we are to
underſtand, ſuch perſons as the promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes <pb n="52" facs="tcp:107768:35"/>are
directed unto, which is Originally and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehenſively to and in Chriſt;
for this we have an Emphatical place, <hi>Gal.</hi> 3.16. <hi>Now to</hi>
Abraham <hi>and his ſeed were the promiſes made,</hi> he ſaith not,
<hi>to ſeeds,</hi> a <hi>many,</hi> but <hi>one</hi> which is Chriſt: ſo
that in a true conſtruction <hi>children of promiſe</hi> and <hi>chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren
of Chriſt</hi> are the ſame, for Chriſt is the appa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent and immediate
heir of the promiſe. 
<p>To confirm this, we have a remarkable place, <hi>Gal.</hi>
3.29. <hi>if ye be Chriſts then are you</hi> Abrahams, and conſequently
<hi>Iſaacs</hi> ſeed, <hi>and heirs according to premiſe;</hi> ſo that
the Apoſtle here doth inſtruct us, that election conſiſts of ſuch a
ſort of perſons ſo qualified, the ſpecifical ſeed of
<hi>Iſaac:</hi> ſuch a kinde of perſons therefore might the Apoſtle
well ſay, <hi>Eph.</hi> 1.4. <hi>according as he hath choſen us, in him,
be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the foundation of the world,</hi> that is in Chriſt.</p>
                     </item>
                     <item> 3. This truth is further confirmed, if we conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der,
that children of promiſe muſt ſuppoſe <hi>children of faith:</hi> a
promiſe requires believing: <hi>Abraham believed Gods promiſe, and it was
accounted for righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſse:</hi> ſo that we have <hi>Iſaac</hi> here
ſet forth as a lively type of the nature, not the number of thoſe who
ſhall be Juſtified and ſaved: as afterwards we have <hi>Pharach</hi>
ſet forth as a lively type of thoſe who ſhall be rejected by God, namely,
ſuch as ſlight and reject God and his long-ſuffering grace in the
Goſpel, which ought and is expected to leade them to repentance,
<hi>Rom.</hi> 2.2.</item>
                  </list>
               </p>
               <p>This Doctrine from hence may be obſerved. 
<q> Doctrine, <hi>That God in chooſing and reprobating man hath
a ſpecial eye to qualifications.</hi>
                  </q>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="53" facs="tcp:107768:35"/>Children of the fleſh are not the children
of God, but the children of faith in Chriſt; not by number and name, but
<hi>ſpecies</hi> and qualifications, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 4.3. <hi>God hath
choſen and ſet apart for himſelf the man that is godly.</hi> St.
<hi>Jude</hi> tells us, certain men were Ordained to that condemnation, and he
doth de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſipher them thus, <hi>ungodly men turning the grace of God into
wantonneſse, and denying the Lord;</hi> ſo that <hi>Iſhmael</hi> and
<hi>Iſaac</hi> are made uſe of here but allego<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rically, as they are,
<hi>Gal.</hi> 4.</p>
               <p>I ſhall ſpeak but a very few words to <hi>ver.</hi> 9. and
winde up this context with a word of Uſe; for this is the word of promiſe,
<hi>at this time will I come and</hi> Sarah <hi>ſhall have a ſon;
Iſaac</hi> is judged a meet type of thoſe who ſhould be begotten by faith
in the free and gratious promiſe of God in the Goſpel: we have in theſe
words contained an explanation of what is ſpoken before; <hi>Iſaac</hi> was
a ſignificant ſon of promiſe, therefore the Apoſtle recites the very
words of the Original promiſe to <hi>Abraham, Gen.</hi> 17.21. <hi>at this
time next year will I return according to the time of life, and</hi> Sarah
<hi>ſhall have a ſon:</hi> ver. 14. <hi>at the time appointed I will
return:</hi> the Apoſtle chang<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth by theſe words, <hi>I will come;</hi>
for God to come is underſtood two ways, 
<list>
                     <item>1. To come in power to help, reſcue or deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver.</item>
                     <item> 2. Sometimes to come is to puniſh,</item>
                  </list>ſometimes for God or Chriſt to come is metaphorically
un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood; as <hi>Rev.</hi> 2.5. his coming is to remove the Candleſtick,
<hi>to come, ver</hi> 16. is to fight againſt them: <hi>chap.</hi> 3.3. is to
come as a thief with ſtrength and reſolution: we have two things
conſiderable in theſe words to <hi>Abraham,</hi> recited by the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle.

                  <list>
                     <item>1. That <hi>Iſaac's</hi> birth is the effect of Gods
coming in power.</item>
                     <item> 2. That God in fulfilling this promiſe admits no
delay, <hi>at this time, at the ſet time:</hi> neither ſoo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner nor later,
but at the ſet time; as it was in the birth of <hi>John the Baptiſt, Luke
the</hi> 1. <hi>his mother went her exact time:</hi>
                     </item>
                  </list>God makes his promiſe returnable at the ſet time, ſo
that <hi>Iſaac's</hi> birth is the effect of Gods coming as to his birth, and
the time of it, and alſo the effect of Gods free promiſe; <hi>Iſaac</hi>
was the ſon of Gods word of promiſe: I ſhall ſum up all in one
Doctrinal concluſion. 
<q>Doctrine, <hi>That a true child of God, and heir of glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, is
one as <hi>Iſaac</hi> was, begotten and brought Jorth by the ſtrength of
the free promiſe of God, not of his own power, ſtrength or
righteouſneſſe:</hi> This our Apoſtle alludes unto, <hi>Titus</hi> 3.
and 5. <hi>not of works of righteouſneſs that we have done.</hi>
                  </q>
               </p>
               <p>I told you in the explication, that <hi>Iſaac's</hi> birth was
an act of free mercy and ſpeciall Providence, for there was no ſtrength in
<hi>Abraham</hi> or <hi>Sarah</hi> to have a childe according to the courſe
of nature; nothing as they could lean upon ſo as to have hope in
themſelves: therefore it is ſaid, <hi>Rom.</hi> 4. that <hi>Abraham
againſt hope believed in hope, vers.</hi> 18. and being not weak in faith, he
conſidered not his own body now dead, nor yet the deadneſs of
<hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rah's</hi> womb: he ſtaggered not, but was fully per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaded that he
that had promiſed was able to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form: and this frame of ſpirit God liked
well in <hi>Abraham, and it was accounted for righteouſneſs;</hi> and
hereupon he was called <hi>the friend of God, James</hi> 2.23.
<hi>Iſaac's</hi> birth was the effect of a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe, <pb n="55" facs="tcp:107768:36"/>and faith in it: ſo was <hi>John's, Luke</hi> the 1. and what
<hi>Elizabeth</hi> ſaid to <hi>Mary,</hi> is certainly true; <hi>vers.</hi>
45. <hi>bleſſed is ſhe, or he that believeth,</hi> for there ſhall be a
performance of what is promiſed: a true child of God is begotten and brought
forth of the promiſe of God in Chriſt, therfore believing: Holy S.
<hi>Paul</hi> could ſay in the behalf of himſelf and the reſt of
believers, <hi>we brethren as</hi> Iſaac, <hi>are chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren of the
promiſe,</hi> that is to ſay, that as <hi>Iſaac's</hi> birth was the
product of the free promiſe of God, ſo is our new birth: and it is a truth,
that we are as weak and unable to ſave our ſelves, of our ſelves, as
<hi>Abraham</hi> was to produce <hi>Iſaac</hi> of him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, without the
mighty interpoſer: for the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe gives a being to Chriſt, and
believing to be the means of ſalvation, <hi>Gen.</hi> 3. <hi>Eſa.</hi> 55.
<hi>I will a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bundantly pardon: look unto me, and be ye ſaved all the ends of
the earth. Eſa.</hi> 45.22.</p>
               <p>There are five inferences to be drawn from the promiſes. 
<list>
                     <item>1. There is no ground from the rejecting the unbelieving
Jews, to conclude that there is a fail<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in Gods promiſes to
<hi>Abraham</hi> and his ſeed, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe God did never intend a carnal
ſeed in that promiſe, but a ſpiritual and believing ſeed, who ſhould
ſeek for juſtification by Chriſt alone: for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>asmuch as <hi>Iſaac's</hi>
birth is a type of Gods method of ſaving ſouls in all ages.</item>
                     <item> 2. Learn from this context the indiſpenſable
ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity of faith, in order to juſtification and ſalvati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on: if
<hi>Abraham</hi> and <hi>Sarah</hi> had not ſeconded Gods promiſe by faith
in it, they had had no <hi>Iſaac:</hi> there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore is the birth ſtrongly
imputed to the faith of them both, <hi>Heb.</hi> 11.11. the birth of
<hi>Iſaac</hi> is not only a promiſe on Gods part, but believing on their
part.</item>

                        <pb n="56" facs="tcp:107768:37"/>3. If the works of the law were
rejected in point of juſtification, which were ſo labourious, painful, and
coſtly, much leſs can goſpel-works juſtifie, which in compariſon are

children are the children of promiſe, that is, begotten upon the promiſe,
then this doth inſtruct a goſpel-miniſter his work and duty, which is to

they all belong to make up the Apoſtles anſwer to their firſt objection:
the Apoſtle is in theſe 4 verſes ſtill carrying on the former
Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, to take off the abſurdity caſt by the Jews upon <hi>Pauls</hi>
Doctrine of free juſtification by faith in Chriſt: their objection (as I
have before-ſhown) was this, if <hi>Abrahams</hi> feed be not juſtified and
ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, then God is not ſo good as his word of pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe to
<hi>Abraham;</hi> but God is as good as his word, therefore <hi>Iſrael</hi>
is juſtified, and thou <hi>Paul</hi> art mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtaken.</p>
            <p>To this the Apoſtle has been labouring in his re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply 
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:107768:38"/>in the former 4. verſes; and to take them off from their
confident opinion of the whole ſeed of <hi>Abraham:</hi> he has been

yet not all his fleſhly ſeed heirs with him, though God ſaid, <hi>In</hi>

            </p>
            <p>And ſince we are now entring upon the borders of the
controverſial part of this chapter about abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lute perſonal election and
reprobation, I ſhall en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour to be as diſtinct, clear and plain, as
poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible I can, that at leaſt what I intend and ſpeak may have a ready
acceſs to your underſtandings and conſciences in the ſight of God.</p>
            <p>And before I come cloſe to the words, as an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troduction to
what ſhall be ſaid, I would premiſe three or four things to be
conſidered to prepare you to what I ſhall ſay directly to theſe
verſes.</p>
            <div type="section">
               <p>1. I beſeech you as a general rule to be obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, not only
in this, but for the right underſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of any ſingle and difficult place
of Scripture, take a diligent heed to the main drift and ſcope of the place
in general: I am well aſſured (as I told you before) that there is no one
thing will more conduce to a right underſtanding of this 9 Chap. of the
<hi>Romans,</hi> then this thing, to know well what is the main Doctrine that
S. <hi>Paul</hi> is deſigned to prove and eſtabliſh, and from thence you
may be aſſured, that all his arguments runs in a direct line to that end,
for it is certain, that he was a work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man <pb n="59" facs="tcp:107768:38"/>that did not take
improper tools to work with, that is to ſay, improper Arguments to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firm
his grand <hi>theſis,</hi> but did anſwer by pertinent and convincing
arguments.</p>
               <p>There are two opinions, and but two, that I know of, founded
upon this portion of Scripture, the one is this, that the Apoſtle in this 9
<hi>Ch.</hi> to the <hi>Rom.</hi> is inſinuating to the Jews, that their
caſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing off and rejection, who for many ages had been Gods peculiar people,
and receiving into love and grafting in the Gentiles, was the effect of Gods
eternal decree before the worlds were made; and their opinion runs thus, that
thoſe whom God hath elected before time, ſhall one time or other have
ſuch means of grace offered to them; as thereby without poſſibility of
miſcarrying they ſhall be brought to believe, and be ſaved: and on the
other hand, that thoſe who are under an eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal degree of reprobation,
muſt by vertue thereof remain under impenitency and unbelief, and ſo
unavoidably muſt periſh: and from this root are ſuch of the Jews (ſaith
this opinion) caſt off and rejected: and without a diligent comparation of
the ſeveral paſſages of this chapter, there doth ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear ſome weak
ground of ſuch an opinion.</p>
               <p>The ſecond opinion upon this context, and Chapt. and Ch.
3.4.10.11. is this, that the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles abſolute deſigne in the whole, is
to prevent or anſwer thoſe objections which were apt to be up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the Jews
hearts againſt his grand Doctrine of juſtification by faith in Chriſt,
which indeed was the main Doctrine, <hi>Chap.</hi> 3.4.10.11.</p>
               <p>Now conſider which of theſe two opinions are likelieſt to
be neareſt the truth: I will give you 5. or 6. Arguments to demonſtrate,
that it muſt be <pb n="60" facs="tcp:107768:39"/>the laſt and not the firſt, and that
the rejecting <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

the effect of Gods abſolute de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cree. 
<list>
                     <item>Firſt, becauſe their caſting off is rendred as the
fruit and effect of their own ſin and diſobedience to Chriſt; ſee
<hi>chap.</hi> 11. and 20. <hi>Well: becauſe of unhelief they were broken
off.</hi>
                     </item>
                     <item> Secondly, becauſe their caſting off is but

<hi>ver.</hi> 23. <hi>they ſhall be grafted in again, if they abide not

<hi>ver.</hi> 26, 27, 28. Now if their blinding and hardening were the fruit of
Gods abſolute de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cree, it could not be reverſt again, as moſt will
ſay.</item>
                     <item> 3. That this could not be the Apoſtles deſigne to
eſtabliſh abſolute perſonal Election, becauſe ſuch a doctrine would
not have comported with his grand deſigne, to convince the Jews of their
ſin in rejecting Jeſus Chriſt; ſuch a Doctrin muſt run in a direct
line of oppoſition: I argue thus; was it a likely way to convince them, to
tell them, that they were neceſſitated to reject Chriſt from the power of
an abſolute Decree: beſides the Jews had cauſe to judge, that the Decree
of Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction was on their ſide, rather then on the Gentil<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>, for they had the promiſes made and
renewed to them from time to time: nay, it is plain, that the Jews in rejecting
Jeſus Chriſt did not anſwer to their predeſtination: See <hi>Luke</hi>
7.30. the Phariſees and Lawyers rejected the counſel of God againſt
themſelves: and S. <hi>Peter</hi> ſaith, they were diſobe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dient to that
whereunto they were appointed.</item>
                     <item> 4. It is plain and clear, that a great part of this
Chapter is ſpent in anſwer to their Objections a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt 
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:107768:39"/>S. <hi>Pauls</hi> Doctrine; which kinde of arguing was
needleſſe, if his deſigne had been to exalt per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonal Election,
therefore the Apoſtles deſigne is to fetforth the nature and quality, not
the number of thoſe who are the true ſeed of <hi>Abraham;</hi> ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
as he had done, <hi>Gal.</hi> 3.29.</item>
                     <item> 5. The Apoſtle himſelf in drawing up his reſult of
all his Arguments, <hi>ver.</hi> 31, 32. wherein he ſhews the true and proper
ground of the Jews miſcarry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and the Gentiles obtaining, he gives not the
ground to lie in a previous decree but in them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, becauſe they
ſought it not by faith, but as it were by the works of the Law.</item>
                     <item> 6. Such an Election and Reprobation (meer perſonal) is
neither proved in this Chapter, nor in any other part of Scripture, nor in any
other part of this Epiſtle.</item>
                     <item> 7. The whole current of this Chapter doth clearly
correſpond to the Second Opinion, that S. <hi>Paul</hi> is taking off all
Objections that lie in the way to contradict juſtification by faith alone,
with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the works of the law:</item>
                  </list>Now my hearts counſel to all that would finde the truth
of God in this Chapter, is to obſerve the ſcope of the Epiſtle and
Chapter: and if you finde the leaſt whiſper in the whole of ſuch a
perſonal and abſolute Election &amp; Reprobation as men ſpeak of, I have
loſt my ſenſe and reaſon: I will be bold to ſay, there is as much in
the <hi>First of Geneſis:</hi> and whereas you poſſibly may have the
perſons of <hi>Eſau</hi> and <hi>Jacob</hi> in your eyes; I anſwer, you
ſhall be forc't to conclude with me before we have done, that the inſtance
of <hi>Eſau</hi> and <hi>Jacob</hi> doth not at all prove ſuch a notion of
perſonal Election or Reprobation, to life or death eternal.</p>

               <pb n="62" facs="tcp:107768:40"/>
               <p>The Second thing which I would premiſe in or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der to clearing
our way, is to know that the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle in theſe four <hi>verſes,</hi> 10,
11, 12, 13. is ſtill car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rying on the ſame deſigne as he was in the four
former <hi>verſes,</hi> which was to point out the true ſeed of
<hi>Abraham</hi> by their qualifications, not name or number: and know this,
that as God before had been declaring his minde more darkly, in the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance
of <hi>Iſhmael</hi> and <hi>Iſaac,</hi> ſo he is now proceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing more
clearly in this inſtance of <hi>Eſau</hi> and <hi>Iacob;</hi> and that he
is proſecuting the ſame matter in hand, is or may be perceived from two
circumſtances. 
<list>
                     <item>1. From the manner of ſpeaking, in the firſt words,
<hi>and not only this,</hi> which kinde of explana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory ſpeaking doth note a
further proſecution of the ſame matter; as it is uſed elſewhere; See
<hi>Rom.</hi> 5.3.11. <hi>chap.</hi> 8.23. where this kinde of ſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
<hi>and not only ſo,</hi> is ſo uſed.</item>
                     <item> 2. That the Apoſtle is carrying on the ſame
Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument, appears from his mending and ſtrength<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning his Argument, for as to
his former argument, and inſtance of <hi>Iſaac</hi> and <hi>Iſhmael,</hi>
the Jews might object ſomething as to the father, the mother, and the childe.

<hi>David,</hi> nor <hi>Iudas</hi> then <hi>Peter,</hi> nor <hi>Eſau</hi>

executed then his threatning was againſt <hi>Niniveh:</hi> It were ſtrange
if what God ſaid <hi>(I ſay)</hi> to <hi>Rebecca,</hi> ſhould be ſo
underſtood of their final eſtate, eſpecially on the left hand. It was
never Gods way to declare the final ſtate of perſons: ſet this inſtance

dread<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful prediction to that godly mother, in anſwer of her pathetical prayer
to God, to know the ground of that <hi>Rebecca</hi>'s ſtrange ſtrugling in
her Womb: as to tell her, one of thoſe two ſhe now went with, ſhould be
hated of God, and damned to all eterni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty; this had been enough to cauſe an

it beget in the parents hard thoughts of God; and deſpair in the children:
whereas <hi>Eſau</hi> as well as <hi>Iacob</hi> was given in as the anſwer

               </p>
               <p>Of each of theſe a very brief word in Order.</p>
               <p>And firſt, I ſhall ſpeak of the ſubjects of this
in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance, which are <hi>Iacob</hi> and <hi>Eſau,</hi> whoſe names are
ſignificant: <hi>Eſau</hi> according to the Hebrew ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifieth
<hi>doing</hi> or <hi>working,</hi> and the reaſon is given, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
<hi>Eſau</hi> came forth at his birth not as a weak and tender infant, but as
a ſtrong grown perſon, all over hairy like a hairy garment.</p>
               <p>The Hebrew word tranſlated <hi>Iacob</hi> ſignifieth a
<hi>Supplanter</hi> or <hi>deceiver:</hi> ſome renders his name <hi>heel</hi>
or <hi>footſtep,</hi> becauſe he took his brother by the heel, puld him
back, and got before him: <hi>Hoſe.</hi> 12. And as his name is changed, it
ſignified a <hi>prince</hi> or <hi>strong prevailer:</hi> theſe two were
twins, begotten and born at once? their birth was one continued birth:
<hi>Jacob</hi> holding his brother by the heel, as one ſaith of them, they
were like one long childe born at once; yet becauſe <hi>Eſau</hi> appeared
firſt, he is called the firſt born and elder brother, <hi>Gen.</hi> 27.32.
theſe children (as I have ſhewn you) were both in an even and equal
capacity, one father, one mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, one birth. Now theſe two children are only
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:107768:43"/>repreſented in the Oracle to <hi>Rebecca</hi> as typical
and allegorical: God made uſe of <hi>Eſau</hi> as a type and
repreſentation of all the cruel and bloudy perſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors in all ages of the
World, they are in all ages called after his name, <hi>Eſau</hi> and
<hi>Edom:</hi> whereas the faithful in all ages carries away the name of
<hi>Iacob</hi> and <hi>Iſrael:</hi> the ſeed of <hi>Iacob,</hi> the
<hi>Iſrael</hi> of God, even in Goſpel days; as I have ſhewn be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore.</p>
               <p>So that <hi>Iacob</hi> and <hi>Eſau</hi> are the two great
fathers typically; they are not ſpoken of in the Oracle to <hi>Rebecca</hi>
as diſtinct perſons, but as to each race: ſee that prophecy that points
at that very day of Chriſts 2d coming, <hi>Obadiah,</hi> 21. <hi>and
ſaviours ſhall come upon</hi> Zion <hi>to judge the mount of</hi> Eſau,
<hi>and the kingdome ſhall be the Lords:</hi> and in that day the houſe of
<hi>Iacob</hi> ſhall be a fire, <hi>ver.</hi> 18.</p>
               <p>2ly, They are not only typically but alligori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cally, that is, as
it is interpreted by our Apoſtle, <hi>Gal.</hi> 4.24. that is, when by one
thing another diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent thing is meant; ſo we have <hi>Iſaac</hi> and
<hi>Iſhmael,</hi> an allegory of the two covenants, the legal from Mount
<hi>Sinai,</hi> and the other that which is by Chriſt, and as thoſe two
ſons of <hi>Abraham</hi> were allegori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal, ſo theſe two ſons of
<hi>Iſaac</hi> muſt be alſo: if we underſtand the Apoſtle in the
preſent text, giving a new inſtance to the ſame end and import with the
former: now as God in ordering <hi>Iſhmael</hi> and his mother to be caſt
out, did therein figure out the rejecting of the law of works as to
juſtification; ſo did he corroborate and ſtrengthen that ſignification
in this ſecond inſtance of <hi>Eſau,</hi> which appears plain in our
text, where he ſaith, <hi>not of works but of the caller;</hi> ſo that the
covenant of works is rejected in caſting out <hi>Iſhmael,</hi> and hating
<hi>Eſau;</hi> ſo that it <pb n="70" facs="tcp:107768:44"/>is plain, that God will have
none accepted or re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived for the legitimate ſeed of <hi>Abraham</hi> nor
<hi>I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaac,</hi> that ſeeks to be juſtified by works; this way is
reprobated, and thus found in it: and that this point is that which the
Apoſtle would prove to this people ſee <hi>Rom.</hi> 3. <hi>for by the
deeds of the law ſhall no fleſh be juſtified in his ſight:</hi> ſo
<hi>vers.</hi> 28. the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe to <hi>Abraham,</hi> that <hi>he ſhould be
heir of the world,</hi> was not through the law, but through faith,
<hi>Rom.</hi> 4.13. <hi>we are all the children of God by faih in Chriſt
Jeſus.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>So that this is a great truth, that reprobation and election is
of works and faith.</p>
               <p>2. That <hi>Eſau</hi> was only a type and repreſentati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of
all wicked men, in all ages, but alſo of the law of works.</p>
               <p>The next thing that I am to ſpeak unto, is, the parentage of
theſe ſubjects <hi>Jacob</hi> and <hi>Eſau;</hi> their father was
<hi>Iſaac,</hi> their mother was <hi>Rebecca:</hi> both godly, praying, holy
perſons; we may gather that <hi>Iſaac</hi> was near 20 years praying to God
that he might have children, and ſo much the more earneſtly, becauſe the
ſpeciall promiſe of God was lodged in him: <hi>in</hi> Iſaac <hi>ſhall
thy ſeed be called<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>
                  </hi> ſaith
God to <hi>Abraham:</hi> and when <hi>Iſaac</hi> ſaw, that this promiſe
ſtuck in the birth, and did not come forward, he ſet himſelf in good
earneſt to ſeek God, the text ſaith, <hi>he entreated</hi> the Lord,
which word ſignifieth earneſt importuning prayer; and the text alſo
ſaith, <hi>Gen</hi> 25.22. <hi>the Lord was entreated:</hi> ſo that to
thoſe parents, theſe children were the an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer of earneſt prayer;
theſe were children of one father, and mother, and twins; yet ſee what a
great difference there was in their natures, before and after their birth.
<hi>Jacob</hi> was a plain man, <hi>Eſau</hi> 
                  <pb n="71" facs="tcp:107768:44"/>took like
<hi>Nimrod,</hi> of whom it is ſaid, <hi>Gen.</hi> 10.9. <hi>that he was a
mighty hunter before the Lord,</hi> or as ſome reade, <hi>of the Lord,</hi>
that is to ſay, <hi>a great perſecutor:</hi> to which alſo
<hi>Eſau</hi> in his poſterity an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered: <hi>Eſau</hi> was the head of
the <hi>Edomites,</hi> and as theſe differed much in their nature and civil
ſtate, ſo alſo in their moral ſtate: <hi>Eſau</hi> is ſtiled <hi>a
prophane perſon,</hi> one that ſlighted ſpirituall things, as they were
contained in his birth-right; I am at the point to dye, and what good will this
birth-right do to me?</p>
               <p>We may note by the way, <hi>that very godly perſons may have a
great difference in their children, and very bad children in anſwer of
prayer:</hi> this was the caſe with <hi>Iſaac</hi> and <hi>Rebecca;</hi>
let not godly parents think ſtrange of this, it was ſo here: but have a
care you do not impute their badneſs to be the ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect of an abſolute
decree of God, as ſome are rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy to do; and ſuch an opinion is the direct
way to diſcourage parents from taking pains with their children.</p>
               <p>2. Have a care of ſetting your love to much up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on your
children, the child that <hi>Iſaac</hi> loved beſt proved worſt; it is
recorded, <hi>Gen.</hi> 25. that <hi>Iſaac loved Eſau;</hi> it was
obſerved by a godly man having occaſion to ſpeak of <hi>Barabbas</hi> a
wicked man, that he carried a ſignificant name; <hi>Bar-abbas</hi> the ſon
of the father; that it was to be feared, that his father too much loved him,
which was one means to ſpoyl him; what a croſs and vexation was
<hi>Eſau</hi> to his father and mother in his marriage? <hi>Gen.</hi> 26. but
I paſs this briefly.</p>

                  </gap> equal condition; then were
theſe words ſpoken: God took ſuch a time to declare it; and
doubtleſſe our Apoſtle doth judge this circumſtance of time 
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:107768:48"/>obſervable, as to his controverſy in hand: this
relation of our Apoſtle many do greatly wreſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to the Apoſtles
intent and meaning, as I ſhall make plain; though it muſt be granted, that
the Apoſtle in this his contention doth as we do ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times by a crooked
ſtick, bend it quite the other way, to the end he might ſet it right: ſo
here doth the Apoſtle decry works, becauſe they too much reſted upon
them: but I ſhall afterwards ſhow you, that by all he ſaith, he doth not
altogether trample upon them; though at firſt ſight his ſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſeems
to give encouragement to ſuch an Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion: ſome from theſe words do urge,
that as <hi>Eſau</hi> is here rejected, ſo are men by name with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the
leaſt regard had to works, either good or evil: and that men are hated,
rejected, choſen, elected, meerly according to the pleaſure of Gods own
will: to which notion we comply thus far, that the gift of ſalvation, and the
terms thereof doth ariſe out of the heart of God, it is freely from the
caller, neither men nor Angels could propound him way or rules herein to go
by.</p>
               <p>But for the diſcharging this opinion, we muſt underſtand,
that it is founded upon a miſtaken foundation about Gods election; the
authors of that perſonal and abſolute election takes it for grant, that
Gods choyce is out of the fallen lump of mankinde: in <hi>Adam,</hi> as they
were all equally fallen in him and run in debt to God, beyond any
poſſibility to pay, and ſo God being the great cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditour, may at his
pleaſure pardon one, and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>act the whole debt of another, without the

<hi>Malachi;</hi> you cannot from that text underſtand a perſonal hatred;
for it is plain, that what is ſaid here is upon a national and plural
account: I cannot finde in all the whole Scripture where God is ſaid to hate
any one ſingle perſon, although I can finde where God hath declared
himſelf to love a par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular perſon, as of <hi>Solomon</hi> and the young

            <p n="7">7ly, Is Gods love and hatred unalterable and unchangeble and

conclude, that you the unbelieving <hi>Iews</hi> may be hated alſo.</p>
            <p>But I ſhall ſum up the whole of what hath been ſpoken to
this context under theſe three heads. 
<list>
                  <item>1. That this whole paſſage reſpecting <hi>Iacob</hi>
and <hi>Eſau</hi> is not, neither can it be underſtood as to them in their
particular diſtinct perſons: but as to their poſterity; and therefore
from hence cannot fairly be drawn perſonal election and reprobation: nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
did what was ſpoken by God take place up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on their perſons in their life
time, as appears plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly from this quotation from <hi>Malachi:</hi> the
<hi>hatred</hi> and <hi>love</hi> there ſpoken of is national, therefore in 
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:107768:59"/>this Oracle, <hi>Iacob</hi> and <hi>Eſau</hi> are only
ſpoken as heads or tipes of two families that ſhould after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
ariſe.</item>
                  <item> 2. We have heard and learned, that this Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minion and
ſervitude, love and hatred is not to be underſtood of election and
reprobation to heaven or hell; there is not one ſillable that ſhould
incline us to ſuch a belief, neither from <hi>Gen.</hi> 25. <hi>Mala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chi</hi>
1. nor the Apoſtle here: and it is ſtrange that a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny from theſe
premiſes ſhould draw ſuch a conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence, as that <hi>Eſau</hi>
either in his perſon or poſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity ſhould be damned eternally, or
<hi>Iacob</hi> ſaved, from theſe places: but only that God hath left
him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf at liberty, to diſpence temporal favours to good and evil
promiſcuouſly on whom he pleaſes, either with or without reſpect to
works, whether good or evil.</item>

<hi>Iacob</hi> and <hi>Eſau</hi> is to poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſs the mindes of the legal
ſelf-righteous Jews, that God, who had an undoubted and undeniable right to
propound his own terms, upon which juſtification ſhould be had, here
utterly rejected the way of juſtification, namely by works: and e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lected or
choſen the way of believing in Jeſus Chriſt to be his way: and that this
purpoſe and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigne of God was pointed out in rejecting <hi>Iſhmael</hi>
and <hi>Eſau,</hi> who were the elder children both of <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braham</hi> and
<hi>Iſaac</hi> alſo, yet both expoſed in their poſterity to a ſtate
of leſs love and favour: and are in effect ſhut out of the proper
inheritance of <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham; that the purpoſe of God according to election
might ſtand, not of works, but of him that calleth:</hi> which is the
ſubſtance of what <hi>Malachi</hi> hath writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten, <hi>Iacob have I loved
and</hi> Eſau <hi>have I hated:</hi> the <pb n="102" facs="tcp:107768:60"/>ſpirit and

            <p>BEfore I proceed to theſe verſes, I judge it may not be
amiſs or needleſs to revive your memo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries with a few words of
introduction; you may <pb n="103" facs="tcp:107768:60"/>remember, that upon the firſt
entrance upon this ſubject, I deſired you diligently to obſerve the main
ſcope and deſigne of the Apoſtle in this Epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle, chapter and context;
as that which would be of a moſt worthy tendency to the right
under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding of the matter in controverſy between S. <hi>Paul</hi> and
his countrey-men the Jews: conſider what is the Apoſtles ultimate deſigne
and ſcope to effect in this his labour: which deſigne we may perceive was
to convince the Jews in theſe five circumſtances following. 
<list>
                  <item>1. To convince them of ſin in not believing in Jeſus
Chriſt, and ſeeking for juſtification another way, namely by the works of
the law.</item>
                  <item> 2. To convince the Jews, that that way of juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication
unto which they did adhere, was a way abſolutely rejected and reprobated of
God, and that Gods purpoſe of election was not to ſtand or be founded upon
that foundation, but by faith in Chriſt.</item>
                  <item> 3. The Apoſtle doth labour to ſatisfy the Jews, that
this was no new Doctrine broacht by him, but a Doctrine preach't by God to
<hi>Abraham;</hi> though to him more darkly in types and figures, in the
caſting out of <hi>Iſhmael</hi> and <hi>Eſau,</hi> from thoſe
privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledges which were external: in theſe his lower paſſages he did
teach higher things, the rejecting the old covenant of works in point of
juſtification, and chooſing the younger Goſpel-covenant.</item>
                  <item> 4. It is the Apoſtles endeavour to convince the Jews,
that God had left himſelf an abſolute and unqueſtionable right to
propoſe his own terms and conditions, upon which he will juſtifie and
ſave, without being impoſed on by the creature; and that this his way which
he hath unalterably and <pb n="104" facs="tcp:107768:61"/>peremptorily fixed and declared,
is the way of <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">
                        <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                     </gap> grace.</item>
                  <item> 5. The Apoſtle is labouring here to convince the Jews,
that their rejecting and caſting off, was no other then the fruit and effects
of their rejection of this his way by Chriſt, as is plain, <hi>vers.</hi> 32.
becauſe they ſought it not by faith, but as it were by the works of the
law.</item>
               </list>
            </p>
            <p>Now theſe conſiderations carried along in our eye will be a
light and guide to us in the follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſubject.</p>
            <p>We now proceed, The Apoſtle having been in the former Uſes
labouring to certify the Jews of the eternal purpoſe and decree of God to
elect and adopt for <hi>Abrahams</hi> children only ſuch as ſhould believe
in Chriſt, and to reject therefrom all o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers of what line ſoever
deſcended, who ſhould depend upon works for that priviledge; and in this
doing he had been vindicating the truth of Gods promiſe to <hi>Abraham,</hi>
againſt their firſt Objection, verſe the 6th; ſhewing them, that the
rejecting ſuch a carnal ſeed of <hi>Abraham</hi> as they were, did no ways
croſs, much leſs make void the word of God, or render it of none
effect.</p>
            <p>He now proceeds in theſe verſes to vindicate the
righteouſneſſe of God in theſe his proceedings, in anſwer to their
ſecond Objection, that God is not only juſt in decreeing this way of
Juſtification, but righteous in his proſecution of the ſame; we may
ſuppoſe, that the Jews were ſatisfied that the Apoſtle had fully
anſwered their firſt Objection; and cleared the way as to the tight ſeed;
the Jews were ready to ſay, <hi>Paul,</hi> thou haſt well ſalved the
truth of Gods word of promiſe, but now how can this comport with the
righteouſneſſe of God <pb n="105" facs="tcp:107768:61"/>and his equity, whilſt he is
rejecting the greateſt number of <hi>Abrahams</hi> ſeed? who have been
wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling, and running, zealouſly labouring in ways of obedience to that law
of God delivered to them: and in the meanwhile receiving into favour the
na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions and ſinners of the Gentiles, either ignorant of or diſobedient to
that law; and that only believing in another: This (ſaith the Jew) favours to
us of unequity and unrighteouſneſſe; and thus the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles anſwer to
their firſt Objection begetteth ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Objection, the anſwer to which is
that which the Apoſtle is running at in the following verſes, namely, to
vindicate the righteouſneſſe of God: The ſubſtance of the Apoſtles
anſwer amounts to thus much; that as Gods rejecting the Jews, the natural
ſeed of <hi>Abaaham,</hi> did no ways intrench upon the truth of his word of
promiſe to <hi>Abraham,</hi> ſo neither doth his rejecting theſe who were
zea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous of the law intrench upon his Juſtice and righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſſe: ſo
that God is righteous in his proceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings though the Jews are not juſtified
by the works of the law.</p>

                     <item> 2. That this Objection is occaſioned by, or from what

of God at leaſt queſtionable.</item>

<list>
                     <item>ſome think this Objection was raiſed from the
Apoſtles quoting of <hi>Jacob</hi> and <hi>Eſau,</hi> with reſpect to the
time when the words were ſpoken to <hi>Rebecea,</hi> which was <hi>before
they had done good or evil, one to be ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, and the other loved:</hi> whereas
they were both equally ſons of <hi>Iſaac,</hi> in whom the promiſe was
lodged; ſome think, that the Jews thought, that <hi>Puul</hi> in this
inſtance had at leaſt implicitely rendred God unrighteous.</item>
                     <item>2. Some think, that the Jews took this advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage from
<hi>Pauls</hi> interpretation of theſe Oracles and inſtances of
<hi>Iſhmael</hi> and <hi>Eſau,</hi> as thus; that God in his proceedings

<hi>ver.</hi> 11. this interpre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation the Jews quarrel at, that <hi>Paul</hi>

ſubju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gating <hi>Eſau</hi> typed out the caſting off the Covenant of
works for Juſtification: this interpretation was very diſtaſteful to the
Jews, who judged it to ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour of unrighteouſneſſe: for God to ſlight

them.</item>

               <p>Now the Queſtion is, which of theſe two are likelieſt to
be the ſpring of this Objection; I anſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer: That it could not ſo properly
be drawn from the firſt as the laſt of theſe foundations, for theſe two
reaſons. 
<list>
                     <item>1. What the Apoſtle ſpeaks concerning <hi>Jacob</hi>
and <hi>Eſau,</hi> was only what was recorded in their own Scripture, and
they dared not to quarrel at that: they had the very words that <hi>Paul</hi>
mentions, <hi>Gen.</hi> 25. <hi>Malachi.</hi> 1.</item>

concerning <hi>Jacob</hi> and <hi>Eſau,</hi> and particularly concerning
<hi>Eſau,</hi> or the <hi>Edomites</hi> that could not offend the Jews,
becauſe the <hi>Edomites</hi> had been their fathers implacable enemies: the

of this Objection muſt ſtand grounded upon the Apoſtles concluſive
inference from the premiſes, <hi>Gen.</hi> 25. <hi>Mal.</hi> 1. that God had
rejected that way of ſaving men on which they de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pended, and choſen the way

                  </list>
               </p>
               <p>1ſt, As to the vindication of Gods righteouſneſs, as to
the ſubjects of mercy: we have it layd down <hi>vers.</hi> 15. as to Gods
righteouſneſſe, with reſpect to the veſſel of wrath, that we have
<hi>verſe</hi> the 17. in that inſtance of <hi>Pharaoh,</hi> the Apoſtle
would aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſert the undeniable right that God hath to ſhew mercy to whom he
will, that is, to what manner of perſons he will: and a ſole right to
reprobate &amp; reject what manner of perſons he will; and they ſhal be
impenitent rebellious rejecters of his mercy and grace, as <hi>Pharaoh</hi>
did, who was a type of the unbelieving Jews, to whom Chriſt was ſent: from
this eminent inſtance of <hi>Pharaoh</hi> the Apoſtle draws up a
concluſion, <hi>that God hardens whom he will, ver.</hi> 18. So that the
Apoſtles deſigne in theſe verſes is to vindicate the
righteouſneſſe of God, both in his de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cree of Juſtification and
Reprobation, that is, as to the terms and method upon which he doth pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed.
For take this by the way, that the great con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt between the Jews and St.
<hi>Paul,</hi> was about the way and terms of Salvation, whether by
circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſion and legal Obedience or through faith in Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus Chriſt; what
ſhall we ſay then? this kinde of ſpeaking is common by the Apoſtle,
ſometimes to awaken Chriſtians to look backwards, and ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
forwards: theſe words may be read theſe three ways: <hi>what then do we
ſay? what then can we ſay?</hi> or as here, <hi>what ſhall we ſay
then?</hi> ſuch kinde of interogatories ſuppoſeth a ſtrong negati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
<hi>we can ſay nothing:</hi> So it may be read, <hi>Rom.</hi> 4.1.

you: if God be for you, who can be againſt you? thus it is to be read,
<hi>chap.</hi> 9.30. 1 <hi>Corinth.</hi> 10.19. <hi>chap.</hi> 11. So that in
theſe words we have two parts. 
<list>
                     <item>1. An Interrogation, <hi>is there unrighteouſneſſe
with God?</hi>
                     </item>
                     <item> 2. This Interrogation is Seconded with a deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mination

                     </item>
                  </list> however it may appear, as if there were
unrighteouſneſſe with God in this matter; yet there is nothing leſſe,
far be it from us to hold or maintain any ſuch noti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on that might reflect
unrighteouſneſſe on God, God forbid.</p>
               <p>But I ſhall be very brief upon this verſe becauſe the
controverſy doth not lye ſo much in this as in ſome other parts of this
chapter; I ſhall only note two Doctrines from this verſe, and ſo proceed.

<q> Firſt Doctrine, <hi>That the greateſt and moſt
neceſſary and moſt glorious truths of Jeſus Chriſt, may be obnoxious
to the cavils and Objections of thoſe who in other matters are maſters of
great reaſon.</hi>
                  </q> 
                  <q> Second Doctrine, <hi>Thoſe Doctrins and opinions what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
they be that reflect any unrighteouſneſſe or hard dealings on God as to
man kinde, ought to be matter of abhorrency to a Chriſtian.</hi>
                  </q>
               </p>
               <p>Of each of theſe a few words.</p>
               <p n="1">1. See this great truth of juſtification by faith
without the deeds of the law; how it was cavilled at by the Jews who were the
profeſſed people of God, and men of great parts; <hi>the preaching of
Chriſt crucified is to the Iews a ſtumbling block, and <pb n="110" facs="tcp:107768:64"/>to the greeks fooliſhneſſe.</hi> 1 <hi>Corinth.</hi> 10.23. and
in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed what truths of that day were there on foot at which the Jews did not
ſtumble? when Chriſt by divine power of God caſt out devils they imputed
it <hi>to the power of the devil,</hi> contrary to there own reaſons; for
their children muſt name over thoſe poſſeſt with the devil the name
of Jeſus; as to the Baptiſm of <hi>Iohn,</hi> though they dare not deny,
but that it was from heaven yet how they cavil at it, and reject it, as alſo
the Doctrine of the reſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection, as a ridiculous thing, appears by their
arguing with Chriſt about it, <hi>Math.</hi> 22. but a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt all the
Doctrines that were on foot in thoſe days, there were none ſo
pertinaciouſly withſtood as this of juſtification by faith: inſomuch
that it is recorded of them, <hi>Act.</hi> 13.44. that they contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicted and
blaſphemed; and that this Doctrine was the occaſion: ſee <hi>vers.</hi>
39. <hi>that by Chriſt all that believe ſhall be juſtified:</hi> ſo
<hi>Act.</hi> 28.26. this is the great Doctrine caviled at; and ſo it was by
the <hi>Romans</hi> and <hi>Galatians,</hi> for the controverſy did not lye
about election of perſons but ways, as is plain. But I ſhall but touch this
head.</p>
               <p n="2">2. That Doctrine or opinion whatſoever, that reflects
any unrighteouſneſs upon God or Chriſt ought to be abhorred by
Chriſtians; the Apoſtle cannot bear with the leaſt ſuppoſition this
way, without a <hi>God forbid,</hi> or <hi>God forgive:</hi> it is a hainous
ſin: it is the nature of a godly man to vindicate the honour and
righteouſneſs of God in all his ways; he is ready to ſtand up for Gods
righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs: ſo doth our Apoſtle elſewhere alſo, <hi>Rom.</hi>
3.4.5. it is one of the attributes of God which his ſervants in all ages have
laboured to vindicate, ſo did Abraham, <hi>Gen.</hi> 18. <hi>ſhall not the
Judge of <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="111" facs="tcp:107768:64"/>earth do right?</hi> ſo did <hi>Iob</hi> take great
pains to vin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicate Gods righteouſneſs: ſo alſo did <hi>David</hi> and
<hi>Ieremy, chap.</hi> 12.1. he lays down that as an eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſhed truth;
let things go how they will, yet God is righteous; <hi>there is no
unrighteouſneſs in God, Pſal.</hi> 29.</p>
               <p>Learn from hence, to try your own hearts as to Godward; if your
hearts be right to Godward, you cannor bear the leaſt imputation to be caſt
up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on Gods righteouſneſſe; <hi>is there unrighteouſneſſe with God?
God forbid.</hi> I need not at this place ſhew you, how diſhonourable to
Gods righteouſneſſe that opinion of election and Reprobation is, which is
commonly impoſed upon this Chapter.</p>
               <p>But I proceed, and having ſpoken a few words as to the
Apoſtles vindication of Gods righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe in general in
<hi>ver.</hi> 14. I ſhall proceed to ſpeak to his more ſpecial
vindication of Gods righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, <hi>ver.</hi> 15. in theſe

Lord, who will have this to live, and that to dye, amongſt men corrupted

ſay but little to this opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion, <pb n="112" facs="tcp:107768:65"/>in this place,
becauſe I ſhall meet with it more fully afterwards.</p>
                  <p>Yet thus much I now ſay, that this kinde of ſpeaking
ſoundeth contrary to the current of other Scriptures; for Gods thoughts of
mercy are as far above our imaginations, as the heavens are above the earth;
<hi>Eſau</hi> 55. <hi>who would have all men to be ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, and come to the

or to this effect (<hi>on whom I once decree to ſhew mercy, I will go on to
ſhew mercy for ever; I will never take it a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way, but follow him with

accommo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>date the Context, and the Apoſtles deſigne, <hi>I</hi> leave the
wiſe to Judge, ſeeing he is now in this context aſſerting, that the

un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>belief.</p>
                  <p>But as the Lord ſhall aſſiſt me I ſhall endeavour to
lay before you the true and genuine ſcope and intent of our Apoſtle in
theſe words; it is plain and granted on all hands, that the Apoſtle in
theſe verſes is labouring to deliver his former Doctrine from the leaſt
imputation of reflecting unrighte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs upon God, as they were ready to
charge upon him: you have heard before, that the ſpring of this objection is
from the Apoſtles interpretati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on drawn from two inſtances of
<hi>Iſhmael</hi> and <hi>Eſau,</hi> which was this: ſee upon
<hi>vers.</hi> 11. that God there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in did teach, <hi>that his purpoſe of
election was not of works but of free grace, or of him that calleth:</hi> here
lyeth the foot of the objection, and it may be fra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med thus: that if thou
teach, that God doth not reward and deal with men according to their works,

according to his works:</hi> and leaſt any ſhould think this objecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, to
be ſubſtantial, I will ſpeak a few words by way of diſtinction unto it;
therefore remember this I pray, that the works ſpoken of, and ſtruck at in
this Epiſtle, chapter and context, are not intended works of faith and
Goſpel-obedience and holy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, but theſe works muſt be underſtood of
legal and ceremonial obedience, as circumciſion and thoſe rites on which
the Jews reſted.</p>

                  <p>Now the buſineſs that the Apoſtle hath before him, is to
vindicate Gods righteouſneſs, notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding which to do, he brings
theſe words to <hi>Moſes:</hi> in which Scripture we have at leaſt

left himſelf, to ſtate and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pound his own terms and conditions upon, how
this grace of Adoption, Juſtification and ſalvation ſhall be enioyed,
whether upon the works of the law or faith; which was the caſe in hand: God
hath an abſolute prerogative without the propoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of men or angels: I
will ſhew (ſaith God) this mercy of juſtification to what kinde of
per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons I pleaſe, which terms (as I have ſhewed be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore) are only
believing in his Son, and no other way whatſoever; which conditions was
wanting in the Jews, notwithſtanding their pertinacious contending with the
holy Apoſtle: for although they had been zealous obſervers of the law as

                  <p>2. Whereas they were ready to quarrel at the reception of the

                  <p>1. I anſwer, This Citation is out of their own law, and ſo
was a good teſtimony to his end, for they owned what was recorded there; Gods
way of ſaving, according to my Doctrine, is no other then what he declared to
<hi>Moſes</hi> of old, that it was <hi>by grace, by compaſſion, not

<hi>Paul</hi> were within the compaſs of Gods works and ſayings: therefore
the Apoſtle to deliver himſelf, cites this ſaying of their Law, that
ſaid as much in effect as he had ſaid; for the Scripture here ſpeaks the
ſame to <hi>Moſes;</hi> this in general: but more particularly, this
ſaying doth accomodate the Apoſtle, if we will conſider the ſpring of
the Jews Objection, as from his Doctrine before laid down, <hi>ver.</hi> 11.
<hi>that Gods purpoſe of election was not of works but of him that

that this text ſpeaks of? when it ſaith, <hi>I will have mercy on whom I

of love and grace ſhown to mankinde from God. 
<list>
                        <item>1. There is one kinde of grace which is antece<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent to
ſaith and obedience, ſuch is the gift of Chriſt and means of
Salvation.</item>

<list>
                        <item>1. Becauſe God makes no difference nor diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction
of men in the firſt, namely the gift of Chriſt, and his preventing grace,
as the learned calls it; in that reſpect it need not run as it doth here,
<hi>I will have mercy on whom I will:</hi> but on all equally alike
<hi>John.</hi> 3.16. <hi>Rom.</hi> 5.8. 1 <hi>John</hi> 4.10. and according to
this love he calls all men every where <hi>to Repent,</hi> Acts. 17. and
<hi>many are called.</hi>
                        </item>
                        <item> 2. The whole diſcourſe of the Apoſtle in this
context, doth not relate to the firſt but the latter: the ſcope of this
Epiſtle doth relate to Juſtification and Adoption, not of preventing grace,
but ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequent <pb n="119" facs="tcp:107768:69"/>grace, according to theſe texts,
<hi>Gal.</hi> 3.26. <hi>chap.</hi> 4.6. 1 <hi>John</hi> 12.</item>
                        <item> 3. It muſt be taken in the latter not the firſt
ſence, becauſe he is taking pains to ſatisfie the Jews, that they were
excluded from that grace and mercy that he is ſpeaking of all along, as
<hi>ver.</hi> the 8th, <hi>the children of the fleſh are not the children of
God, but the children of the promiſe are accounted for the
ſeed:</hi>
                        </item>
                     </list>but none will venture to ſay, that the Jews are
excluded from Gods preventing grace; they had the benefits of Chriſts death
and the pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viledges of the Goſpel; So that it is not here to be read or
underſtood, <hi>I will have mercy,</hi> that is, chooſe unregenerate men,
and thereby draw, nay force and neceſſitate them to repentance and faith,
but I will juſtifie and ſave what kinde of perſons I pleaſe and upon
what terms I pleaſe.</p>

ſpeaker; as when <hi>Tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mas</hi> ſaith, <hi>my Lord and my God,</hi> he

pardon, yet he may ſue it out as the grace of the prince: It is our duty to

ſpeaks concerning ſome things in his beloved brother <hi>Pauls</hi>
writings, which (as he ſaith) <hi>the unlearned wreſt,</hi> as they do
other Scriptures, <hi>to their own deſtruction.</hi> Now amongſt theſe
dark and obſcure paſſages, this ſeems to be one, concerning
<hi>Pha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raoh:</hi> now a right underſtanding of this paſſage re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quires
divine aſſiſtance, in conjunction with a narrow ſearch, and diligent,
and ſtudious com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paration of Scriptures; the latter of which I can ſay,
that I have not been wanting in to my pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er: and foraſmuch as it is Gods
work to open our underſtandings to underſtand the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, I deſire
the reader to be humbly wai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting upon him for light, as he goeth along in the
following matter. It is agreed on by moſt writers, that the Apoſtle is
ſtill proſecuting his anſwer to the ſecond objection, levyed againſt
his <pb n="140" facs="tcp:107768:80"/>Doctrine by the Jews, which objection was
occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſioned by his anſwer to the firſt; and having an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered the
firſt branch, and vindicated Gods righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs in ſhewing mercy to
whom, or what ſort of perſons he pleaſe, and upon what terms, from that
ſaying of God to <hi>Moſes</hi> of old, he now in theſe words proceeds to
the ſecond branch of his anſwer, which is, to vindicate &amp; demonſtrate
Gods righteouſneſs in condemning, rejecting and hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning whom he pleaſe,
or rather what manner of perſons he pleaſe: Now his anſwer in this
ſecond branch, the Apoſtle buildeth upon another antient ſaying of God by
way of threatning to <hi>Pharaoh</hi> by the mouth of <hi>Moſes, Exo.</hi>
9.16. which ſaying of God to <hi>Moſes</hi> is the ſubject of our text.
The argument in general is formed thus; that as God is righteous and juſt, in
taking what ſort of per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons he pleaſe, as the ſubjects of his mercy,
<hi>Exo.</hi> 33.19. <hi>I will have mercy on whom I will have mercy,</hi> ſo
in like manner is God righteous and juſt, in making whom he pleaſe the
ſubjects of his wrath and condemnation; even <hi>ſome of the circumciſed
ſeed of</hi> Abraham, <hi>according to the fleſh,</hi> the ſubjects of

being ſuch, who had not (as <hi>Calvin</hi> ſaith on <hi>vers.</hi> 31.)
complyed with thoſe terms preſcribed and authorized by God for
juſtification, but rebelling againſt the ſame; ſo he: how Gods
rejecting and reprobating ſuch willfull rejecters of him, his grace and
mercy, patience, and long ſufferings, in his unwearied applications to them,
was emphatically held forth, in his pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedings with <hi>Pharaoh,</hi> which
is now the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject before us: and that theſe proceedings of God on both
ſides, are the effects of an eternal de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cree of election and reprobation from
the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, <pb n="141" facs="tcp:107768:80"/>is granted; and that this decree of
reproba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion is ſubſervient to Gods decree of election and ſalvation; and
is as conducible to the ſalvation of men as any other decree whatſoever:
and S. <hi>Paul</hi> made uſe of Gods decree of reprobation to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mote his
own ſalvation, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 9.27. <hi>I keep under my body, and bring it

               </p>
               <p>I might add by way of illuſtration, that the pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal part of

                     </list> I think we may be at li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty to take them either way:
if it relates to the 14. <hi>verſe,</hi> then it runneth thus, <hi>is there
unrighte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs in God, God forbid; for the Scripture ſaith unto
Pharaoh:</hi> God is not unrighteous in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demning unbelievers who are
contemners of his grace; as the Jews are to whom he ſpeaks; <hi>for the
Scripture ſaith unto Pharaoh:</hi> meaning, that God, proceedings with
<hi>Pharaoh,</hi> a ſtubborn and impe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitent unbeliever even to
deſtruction, is a juſt ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument, that God is righteous in ſo proceeding
with others in the like capacity, and ſo with whom he pleaſe: and the
connexion thus conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red doth agree to the Apoſtles concluſion,
<hi>vers.</hi> 18. <hi>ſo then he ſhews mercy to whom he will, and whom he
will he hardens.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>But ſuppoſe we make the connexion with <hi>verſe</hi>
16. <hi>it is not of him that willeth nor of him that run<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth, but in God that
ſheweth mercy, for the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture ſaith unto Pharaoh;</hi> then it follows
thus, that the laws, terms, and conditions upon which men are juſtified, are
not moulded or framed by men though never ſo zealouſly bent and intent that
way, but by and from God only, who is the donor, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe <hi>the Scripture
ſaith unto Pharaoh,</hi> meaning that inaſmuch as God claimeth a juſt and
unqueſtiona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble right to condemn whom he pleaſe, he hath the ſame right
to ſave whom he pleaſe; ſo that the way by which the Apoſtle clears
Gods righteouſneſs in his proceedings with Jews and Gentiles, is 
<pb n="143" facs="tcp:107768:81"/>his undoubted right thereunto: God is not unrigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous in
juſtifying the gentils by faith, neither is he unrighteous in condemning, and
hardning the obſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate unbelieving Iews, becauſe he was righteous in ſo
proceeding with <hi>Pharaoh</hi> upon like grounds of diſobedience: no man
ever queſtioned the righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſſe of Gods proceedings with
<hi>Pharaoh,</hi> but juſtified him in it, therefore the Apoſtle makes him
here a preſident, <hi>Pharaoh</hi> being the firſt born of rebellious
unbelievers and obſtinate diſobeyers of God, and a type of all
goſpel-diſobeyers to the worlds end: and ſo his proceedings with him a
pat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tern of Gods proceedings with ſuch to the worlds end: as in like manner
when God declares his ſole love and approbation to <hi>Abraham,</hi> upon his
believing, he doth alſo declare his good liking to all ſuch like believers
in all ſucceding generations; <hi>Abraham</hi> the firſt-born of believing
and obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent ſouls, he is the father of obedience, as <hi>Pha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raoh</hi> was
the father of diſobedience, not that the children of theſe two grand heads
are in degree e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>qual to <hi>Abraham</hi> in faith, or <hi>Pharaoh</hi> in
diſobedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, but their faith and their diſobedience are of the ſame
<hi>ſpecies</hi> that their fathers was, as <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham</hi> may have many
ſons or children who comes not to equalize him in the degree of his faith,
pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided it be of the ſame kinde, even ſo may <hi>Pharaoh</hi> have ſons
who may be heirs and lyable to the ſame hardning and condemning, who
notwithſtanding have not diſobeyed to the degree of <hi>Pharaohs</hi>
diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>obedience; and it is a certain truth, that amongſt all people and
perſons that have been ſince <hi>Pha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raohs</hi> time, none ever came ſo
near to the degree of <hi>Pharaohs</hi> diſobedience, as theſe Jews, to
whom the Apoſtle is ſpeaking, as afterwards I ſhall de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monſtrate 
<pb n="144" facs="tcp:107768:82"/>by the circumſtances of them both: for that from this
caſual word <hi>(for),</hi> we may eaſily gather, that this inſtance of
<hi>Pharaoh</hi> is not forreign to the Apoſtles buſineſſe in hand; but
it doth ſuit with it, to help to carry on his deſigne in vindica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of
the righteouſneſſe of God, both in ſhewing mercy and in hardning.</p>

                  <p>The ſecond circumſtance to be taken notice of, is the
ſpeaker of theſe words which is here appro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priated to the Scriptures, the
<hi>Scripture ſaith unto Pharaoh,</hi> which conſideration (by the way) may
be of inſtruction to us, of the divine authority of the Scriptures; for
notwithſtanding theſe words are the words of God, yet the Apoſtle
ſaith, <hi>the Scripture-ſaith, I have raiſed thee up to make my power
known:</hi> what God ſpeaks and what the Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture ſaith, are the ſame
with the Apoſtle, and ſo it is elſewhere; ſee <hi>Gal.</hi> 3.22. where
he ſaith, the Scriptures hath concluded all in unbelief, which the ſame
Apoſtle appropriates to God, <hi>Rom.</hi> 11.32. So 1 <hi>Timot.</hi> 5.18.
<hi>the Scripture ſaith, thou ſhalt not muzzle the mouth of the oxe,</hi>
which are a part of Gods words: I muſt take up this by the way, that
ſayings of God, and ſayings of Scripture are of e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>qual authority, and it
muſt needs be ſo, becauſe the ſayings of Scripture are the breathings
of God by his ſpirit, in his ſervants: ſee what <hi>Peter</hi> ſaith to
this 2d <hi>Peter.</hi> 1. <hi>laſt verſe</hi> 2. <hi>Timothy.</hi> 3. but
why ſeeing Gods ſayings, and ſayings of Scripture are the ſame, doth
the Apoſtle rather chooſe to ſay here, <hi>the Scripture ſaith,</hi>
rather then <hi>God ſaith,</hi> as before <hi>verſe</hi> the 15. I
anſwer, the Apoſtle might chooſe his way to declare it, that he might
pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voke the Jews to conſult and conſider the whole paſſage, as they
had it in their law; which alſo <pb n="145" facs="tcp:107768:82"/>did ſo greatly concern
them; and for the ſame rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon doth he ſo often uſe this dialect,
<hi>the Scripture ſaith,</hi> as <hi>Rom.</hi> 10.11. <hi>chap.</hi> 11.2.
and many other places.</p>
                  <p>2. It is conſiderable, that whilſt he is ſaying that
<hi>the Scripture ſaith;</hi> he ſo rendreth it in the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent tenſe,
he therein gives the Jews to underſtand, that this ſaying is a ſtanding
word, not only ſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken, but ſpeaking, it is a ſpeaking Oracle: what was

                  </p>
                  <p>I will only add a word of inſtruction, ſee the choice
eſteem the holy Apoſtle had for the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures; whilſt he reckons the
Scripture ſayings, and the ſayings of God equal, Gods faithful ſervants
in all ages have been diſtinguiſhed by this; their worthy eſteem of the

hand, which was to convince the Jews of their horrid ſin in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jecting and
killing Jeſus Chriſt, and rejecting the Goſpel; it was not a likely way,
nor a convin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing argument to tell them, that they were neceſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tated to do
what they did, and be what they were, by the power of an abſolute decree from
eternity concerning them: would any parent ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving a diſobedient ſon, and
taking bad courſes, uſe this argument to reduce him, to tell him he was
decreed and ordained to be what he is, and do what he do, by an abſolute and
unavoidable de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cree of reprobation from eternity, I leave the Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicious Reader
to conſider; I ſhall have occaſion to ſpeak more of this
afterwards.</p>
               <p>Now in order to Explication, let us enquire into theſe Five
following Circumſtances. 
<list>
                     <item>1. To what end doth our Apoſtle now bring in this
paſſage of <hi>Pharaoh,</hi> and how doth it accomo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>date his preſent
deſigne to clear up the righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of God againſt the Jews
Objection, which is his preſent work?</item>
                     <item> 2. I ſhall open the nature of Gods purpoſe and 
<pb n="149" facs="tcp:107768:84"/>intention concerning <hi>Pharaoh,</hi> that is to ſay,
whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Gods purpoſes are abſolute or conditional, becauſe the Apoſtle
renders it, <hi>for this cauſe have I raiſed thee up.</hi>
                     </item>
                     <item> 3. Shew how God raiſed up <hi>Pharaoh,</hi> or what
God did for <hi>Pharaoh</hi> called here <hi>raiſing him up.</hi>
                     </item>
                     <item> 4. What is that power that God threatens to put forth
towards <hi>Pharaoh</hi> in his dealings with him.</item>
                     <item> 5. What part or parts of Gods Name is decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red in the
world, or throughout the earth, in de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroying <hi>Pharaoh,</hi> after that
way and manner which he did.</item>
                  </list>
               </p>
               <p>As to Gods hardning <hi>Pharaoh</hi> I ſhall not ſpeak to it
on this ver. becauſe it will fall in more properly in the handling the next
verſe where that is expreſt.</p>
               <div type="subsection">
                  <p>1. How doth this paſſage of <hi>Pharaoh</hi> accomo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>date
the Apoſtles deſigne in juſtifying Gods righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs, which is his
preſent work, in anſwer to the ſecond Objection?</p>
                  <p>I anſwer, his deſigne in bringing in this example and
inſtance of <hi>Pharaoh,</hi> is to ſhew, that God is righteous in
rejecting the ſtubborn, diſobedient, rebellious Jews, who had rejected the
many ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plications of God to them, that is, deprive them of all their outward
priviledges and the good pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed them; and to cauſe them to ceaſe to be
a body politique, but to be a people diſperſt up and down the world, which
is now their preſent ſtate: the Apoſtle argueth thus, if Gods will and
plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure was (and that moſt righteous) to threaten <hi>Pharaoh</hi> an
obſtinate rebellious perſon, that if he perſiſted in his rebellion he
would deſtroy him with a moſt prodigious deſtruction, which alſo was
performed accordingly thereupon; he may <pb n="150" facs="tcp:107768:85"/>juſtly do ſo
with others of the like kinde, and conſequently with you; the Jews whoſe
ſtubborn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe and rebellion againſt God, in order to Chriſt and the
Goſpel, doth clearly reſemble that of <hi>Phe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raoh;</hi> what God did by
<hi>Pharoah</hi> he may do by you, for the ſame ſins, if you perſiſt in
them as he did<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> this is the Apoſtles Argument.</p>
                  <p n="2">And 2ly, the Apoſtle might well bring in
<hi>Pha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raoh,</hi> he being in order the firſt and moſt notorious in that
ſin of diſobedience againſt God with a high hand; he was the head &amp;
father and firſt-born of all that race, as <hi>Abraham</hi> was the head
&amp; father of all true believers; and therefore the Apoſtle cites Gods
dealing with the father to inſtruct all his fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing children, of like
ſtrain, what they muſt look for at his hands: <hi>Pharaoh</hi> is here
brought in as a proper parallel inſtance, in his ſin and puniſhment, in
theſe five circumſtances. 
<list>
                        <item>1. God ſent a loving meſſage to <hi>Pharaoh</hi>
king of <hi>Egypt,</hi> to deſire him to let his firſt-born ſon
<hi>Iſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rael</hi> go out of his land; ſo God ſent a loving meſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſage to
the Jews to invite them to believe in his only begotten ſon Jeſus Chriſt;
but as <hi>Pharaoh</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſed in ſlighting terms, ſo did they.</item>
                        <item> 2. As <hi>Pharaoh</hi> was a cruel oppreſſor to
Gods Son the <hi>Iſraelites,</hi> ſo were the Jews to Gods on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly begotten
Son Jeſus Chriſt, they were cruel un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to him; and that <hi>Iſraels</hi>
being in <hi>Egypt</hi> did type out the ſtate and condition of Chriſt is
plain. See <hi>Matth.</hi> 2.25. <hi>that the Scripture might be fullfilled, I
have called my ſon out of Egypt.</hi>
                        </item>
                        <item> 3. As God did not ceaſe in <hi>Pharaohs</hi>
rejecting the firſt meſſage, but ſends ſeveral more, even ſo did
God to the Jews, he ſent ſervant after ſervant, till they miſus'd them,
and at laſt they kill the ſon; as we have it in the parable.</item>
                        <item> 
                           <pb n="151" facs="tcp:107768:85"/>4. As <hi>Pharaoh</hi> was
hardned and ſtrengthned in his rebellion againſt God, by his
long-ſuffering &amp; patience toward him, ſo it was with the Jews, for
<hi>he ſtretched out his hand to a gainſaying and a rebel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lious
people.</hi>
                        </item>
                        <item> 5. As God at laſt ſealed up <hi>Pharaoh</hi> in
his obdu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rateneſſe and impenitency, ſo did he do with the Jews;
foraſmuch as they had ſhut their eyes and ears, God at laſt gives them up
to a judicial blind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, as we reade <hi>Act.</hi> 28.26,27.</item>
                     </list> ſo that the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent of bringing <hi>Pharaoh</hi> upon
the ſtage at this time, is to demonſtrate, 
<list>
                        <item>1. That God is at liberty to deſtroy what ſort of
perſons he will, whether debauched, profane ſinners of the Gentiles, meerly
for ſuch their wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kedneſſe, or whether Jews and Gentiles for rebel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
againſt the goſpel and the tenders thereof.</item>
                        <item> 2. This liberty of his doth iſſue in this, that he
will pitch upon (without reſpect of perſons) Jews and Gentiles, who are
wilfull rejecters of his grace and mercy in Jeſus Chriſt, to be the
ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects of reprobation; as well the Jews who are ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervant of
<hi>Moſes</hi> Law as the idolatrous gentiles;</item>
                     </list>ſo that the Apoſtle doth not here bring
<hi>Pharaoh</hi> as a type of perſonal reprobation, but a ſpecifical of
ſuch a kind, qualified &amp; fitted for deſtruction, as he was not
perſonal reprobation, for theſe Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons. 
<list>
                        <item>1. That would not have accomodated his grand deſigne
in this Epiſtle, Chapter and Context, as I have ſaid before, which was to
exalt and magni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie faith in Chriſt, as the alone condition, law and terms of
juſtification, without the works of the law. Now if the Apoſtles deſigne
had been to aſſert and maintain perſonal Election and Repro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bation 
<pb n="152" facs="tcp:107768:86"/>without any regard to qualifications of the creature, but
the only pleaſure of God, he need not ſtrive as he doth about faith and
works.</item>
                        <item> 2. This was not the way to humble the Jews for their
unbelief and crucifixion of Jeſus Chriſt, and rejecting the goſpel, which
was his preſent work, as I have ſaid before.</item>
                        <item> 3. If his deſigne had been to exalt perſonal
E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lection and Reprobation, without terms and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions, this Inſtance of
<hi>Pharaoh</hi> would not have conduced to his end, becauſe all the world
will grant, that <hi>Pharaoh</hi> was deſtroied for his diſobe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience and
open rebellion againſt God, and abu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing his long-ſuffering and mercy, in
his many ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plications to him; the man hath not yet been heard of who hath not
juſtified God in his proceedings with <hi>Pharaoh.</hi>
                        </item>
                        <item> 4. Beſides, it is undeniably plain, that the
Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle brings in this inſtance of <hi>Pharaoh</hi> as a type of national
not perſonal reprobation, inaſmuch as it is by the Apoſtle applyed to the
nation of the Jews.</item>
                        <item>5. Whatever we may gather or conclude by
cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances, yet we have no Scripture in the whole book of God that
ſpeaks any thing of <hi>Pharaoh</hi> him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf as reprobated to eternal
miſery; all Gods threatnings mentioned and executed, referred to his temporal
overthrow, at leaſt in the ſea, as the like was before ſpoken concerning
<hi>Eſau</hi> and <hi>Iſhma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>el;</hi> though conſequently it muſt follow
that he d<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                              <desc>•</desc>
                           </gap>
                           <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in impenitency, it
can amount to no leſs then perdition to eternity; yet (I ſay) the
Scriptures doth not convincingly aſſert it in any place, though it is
granted on all hands, that <hi>Pharaoh</hi> is exhibited as a type of thoſe
who ſhall eternally periſh in a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buſing Gods grace and mercy:</item>
                     </list> ſo that we ſee, this <pb n="153" facs="tcp:107768:86"/>inſtance of <hi>Pharaoh</hi> did accomodate the Apoſtle, if righly
underſtood; in vindicating the righteouſneſs of God, whilſt he is
rejecting the rebellious Jews.</p>
               </div>
               <div type="subsection">
                  <p>The ſecond thing to be enquired into is; how far the
purpoſe and intent of God muſt be underſtood to be abſolute; and how
far conditional? whether this purpoſe of God as to <hi>Pharaohs</hi>
deſtruction was ſo preciſe and abſolute, that no interveniences of
<hi>Pharaoh</hi> could prevent or hinder it? or whether it were conditional,
that is to ſay, that if <hi>Pharaoh</hi> did repent, and at laſt quietly
yield to let <hi>Iſrael</hi> depart his land and not purſue them, whether
then this wrath of God had not been diverted?</p>
                  <p>The anſwer of this queſtion is of great concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to a
right underſtanding of this paſſage, in an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer whereunto I ſhall
ſpeak a few words in order to the general opinion of men about this
queſtion: It is commonly objected, that <hi>Pharaoh</hi> from firſt to
laſt of Gods ſending to him, was in no capacity to repent, but ſhut up by
God in a ſtate of impeni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tency. I ſhall reply more fully to that, upon
<hi>ver.</hi> 18. yet at preſent I ſhall ſpeak a few words; and by the
way I ſay this, that to ſuppoſe that God by vertue of his eternal decree
of reprobation, had laid upon <hi>Pharaoh</hi> an unavoidable neceſſity of
re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>belling againſt him, is a high charge againſt the moſt pure and
righteous God, and little leſs then blaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phemy to ſay or think, God doth
not neceſſitate that to be done which his ſoul abhors to be done: but
ſome moderate men will plead thus; that he did foreſee <hi>Pharaohs</hi>
rebellion and impenitency: I anſwer, and it is not my judgment alone, that
God cannot in a proper and ſtrict ſence be ſaid to foreſee any thing,
for he ſees all at once as done; but were it underſtood as fore-ſight in
God, Gods <pb n="154" facs="tcp:107768:87"/>fore-ſight of things done or to be done in the
world, doth not neceſſitate theſe things to be done: this was a received
maxim of old amongſt the learned, and it may be as well ſaid, that God
fore-ſaw that he might have repented; and thoſe mercies that God uſed
with him were not only proper and ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectual mercies to draw <hi>Pharaoh</hi>
to repentance, but did to ſome degree effect it by fits; for he did
ſometimes yield and promiſe to obey.</p>
                  <p>But to come cloſer to the matter; I muſt ſay, that
unleſs Gods dealings with <hi>Pharaoh</hi> was diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent from his dealings
with all nations, perſons and people, throughout all ages, there muſt be
ſuppoſed a condition in this threatning to him from God, at leaſt
implyed, if not expreſt, that is to ſay, that unleſs <hi>Pharaoh</hi>
would ſpeedily and wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingly let <hi>Iſrael</hi> depart his land, he would
make known his avenging power in his deſtruction: now that this is the
general terms of Gods procee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dings is plain, whether as to temporal or eternal
deſtructions, and ſometimes the conditions are expreſt, as <hi>Jer.</hi>
18.7,8. <hi>If I pronounce evil againſt a nation or people, to pluck up, pull
down, or deſtroy, if they repent, I will repent:</hi> ſo it is ſuppoſed
on the contrary, as to <hi>Eli's</hi> houſe, 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 2.30. <hi>I
ſaid, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed his houſe ſhould continue for ever; but now far
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>e it from me;</hi> there was a
decree gone out, <hi>Zeph.</hi> 2.2. yet they are exhorted to repent before the
decree bring forth: <hi>God ſware to</hi> Iſrael <hi>to give them the land
of Canaan,</hi> but it ſeems it was conditional, <hi>Numb.</hi> 14. and ſo
in general, there is a condition in Gods higheſt promiſes and threatnings:
and why ſhould we think this to <hi>Pharaoh</hi> had no conditions annex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
to it? we grant, that the conditions are not al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways expreſt, but Gods
threatnings ſeem to be <pb n="155" facs="tcp:107768:87"/>poſitive, as in
<hi>Niniveh's</hi> caſe; <hi>Jonas</hi> himſelf thought it had been
poſitive; as appears by his diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>content at the appearance of the condition:
have we not poſitive ſayings and determinations, that ſuch and ſuch
ſhall not inherit heaven? 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 6. <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 5. yet they
had a condition, <hi>except they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent:</hi> and have we not reaſon to
believe, that Gods purpoſe unto, and concerning <hi>Pharaoh,</hi> is of the
nature of all the reſt in Scripture? but we have ſome who will venture to
tell us, that God hath two wills, a ſecret and a revealed will or purpoſe;
and that albeit by his revealed will he would have all men ſaved, yet his
ſecret will and purpoſe is, that the far greater number ſhall eternally
periſh: to which I reply, that were it granted, that God hath two wills, a
ſecret and a revealed, yet this I finde that Gods revealed will is the moſt
ſevere and haſty, and his ſecret will moſt mercifull; as appears by all
the former inſtances: his revealed will was, that <hi>Niniveh</hi> ſhould
be deſtroyed, whilſt his ſecret will was, that it ſhould remain, if it
did repent.</p>
                  <p>2ly, As to anſwer this queſtion, I do ſay, that God did
manifeſt, that there was a condition in the bowels of that threatning to
<hi>Pharaoh;</hi> and that God did ſeek and labour with <hi>Pharaoh</hi> to
draw him to repentance, and that by proper and ſuita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble means; the very
tendency whereof, was to lead to repentance, namely, thoſe miraculous
judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments on the one hand, and thoſe deliverances on the other: theſe did
both tend to draw <hi>Pharaoh</hi> to a compliance with God: it is a ſaying
of the ſynod of <hi>Dort, that we muſt more conſider the efficacy of the
means in themſelves, then their ſucceſſes;</hi> Gods means was
ſufficient, though the end was not ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected: <pb n="156" facs="tcp:107768:88"/>but ſome
will further pleade, could not God have ſo handled <hi>Pharaoh</hi> if he had
pleaſed, that he ſhould have complyed, and let <hi>Iſrael</hi> go,
without all thoſe plagues and deſtruction at laſt: this queſtion
requires a double anſwer. 
<list>
                        <item>1. That the power of God ſimply conſidered in it
ſelf, without that regulation which it admits of, could have effected it, for
had God refuſed to take off any of thoſe judgments till he had permitted
<hi>Iſrael</hi> to depart, doubtleſs it had been done rather then
<hi>Pharaoh</hi> would have ſuffered his whole land to be deſtroyed.</item>
                        <item> But 2ly, If we ſpeak of the power of God regu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lated,
managed or acted forth by his wiſdome and underſtanding, and in conjunction
with his righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs, he was not able, or had not power to work
<hi>Pharaoh</hi> to repentance, or prevent deſtructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on;</item>
                     </list>for God cannot do any thing unwiſely or
un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>righteouſly, by the ſame rule, as he cannot ly nor deny himſelf,
<hi>Eſa.</hi> 5. <hi>as to his vineyard he could do no more then he had
done;</hi> whereas in a ſtrict ſence he could have done much more, ſent
many more pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets, even without number<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> but it muſt be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood,
he could not honourably, wiſely and righteouſly have done more: we have
ſuch another inſtance, 2 <hi>Cron.</hi> 36.15,16. without remedy God had
leſt himſelf no more means to heal them, ſo <hi>Mark.</hi> 6.5.
<hi>Chriſt could do no mighty works:</hi> ſuch a kinde of ſpeech we have,
<hi>Act.</hi> 27. though God had given S. <hi>Paul</hi> the lives of all that
failed with him in the ſhip, yet (ſaith he) <hi>except ye abide in the
ſhip ye cannot be ſaved:</hi> God is not bound ſo force men to repentance
againſt their wills, or be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond an uſual way; ſo God could have kept
<hi>Adam</hi> and the Angels from falling, by his abſolute pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, 
<pb n="157" facs="tcp:107768:88"/>without this regulation by wiſdome and coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſel: but
it is further objected, that if Gods pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe as to <hi>Pharaoh,</hi> and
others, be conditional, then there ſeems not to be ſo much weight or dread
in Gods threatnings, for the execution of them is ſuſpended upon the
creatures repentance; is not this ſome blemiſh to Gods honour? I anſwer,
that there is a ſence wherein all the counſels and pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſes of God are
abſolute and peremptory, unal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terable and unchangable, and are like the great
mountains that cannot be removed by men nor An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels; as for inſtance Gods
eternal purpoſe is to ſave all that continue in faith and love to the end,
this is unchangable like God himſelf.</p>
                  <p>2. That all unbelieving rebellious rejecters of his
goſpel-grace ſhall periſh eternally, this decree is as abſolute:
theſe are eſtabliſhed by a decree that cannot be reverſed: and thus
Gods purpoſe to <hi>Pharaoh</hi> muſt ſtand, which was this, that if he
did ſtill exalt himſelf againſt God, and not let <hi>Iſrael</hi> go,
then his great power ſhould certainly be ſeen in his deſtruction: the
condition of his repentance is implyed not expreſt.</p>
               </div>
               <div type="subsection">
                  <p>The third Particular we are to enquire after, is, what God did
to <hi>Pharaoh</hi> called here, <hi>raiſing him up?</hi> what doth this
<hi>raiſing up</hi> refer unto? there are many underſtandings and
interpretations upon theſe words; ſome underſtands this <hi>raiſing
up</hi> to refer to his creation, others underſtand this <hi>raiſing
up</hi> to be his making him <hi>King of Egypt:</hi> but I ſhall be much
ſwayed by the original words, and the conſent of the generallity of antient
Authors here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in: the greek word tranſlated <hi>raiſed thee up,</hi>
ſigni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fieth (as the learned in the greek tells us) <hi>to raiſe out of
ſome low ſtate and condition,</hi> ſometimes out <pb n="158" facs="tcp:107768:89"/>of
ſome ſickneſs or diſeaſe: ſo it is uſed, <hi>Jam.</hi> 5.15.
ſometimes out of the grave: <hi>Pharaoh</hi> was (in a ſence) often in the
grave, or dead as we ſay, for his rebellion reiterated: the hebrew words from
whence the Apoſtle draws this, Latined <hi>(ſtere feci)</hi> is read thus:
<hi>I have made thee to ſtand,</hi> the vulgar lattin reades it, <hi>I have
ſuſtained thee;</hi> the Septuagint reades, <hi>thou wert kept alive;</hi>
the Chaldee Paraphraſe reads, <hi>for this cauſe have I endured thee or
patiently born with thee:</hi> to which agreeth <hi>verſe</hi> 22. <hi>he
endureth with long-ſuffering;</hi> God had raiſed him up, and delivered him
from ſix ſeveral plagues and ſtill ſaved him in perſon a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>live: the
generallity of interpreters as well <hi>Cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viniſts</hi> as others, do
receive this as the moſt pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per reading: <hi>I have made thee to ſtand, I
have kept or ſuſtained thee;</hi> thou haſt often been laid low un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
the ſentence of death, but upon <hi>Moſeſes</hi> in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terceſſion I have
raiſed thee up, I have reſcued thee, I have forgiven thy diſobedience,
and tryed thee again; yet with this purpoſe, that if ſtill af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter all this,
thou ſhould'ſt remain obſtinate and rebellious, then the ſtroke ſhall
be the heavier at laſt: my power ſhall be ſeen in thy deſtruction,
which ſhall be ſo prodigious, that all the world ſhall ring of it; <hi>it
ſhall be known in all the earth:</hi> now that this <hi>raiſing up
Pharaoh</hi> could not refer to his creation or raiſing him to be king, as
ſome would have it, but muſt reſpect the proceedings and dealings of God
with him in this preſent treaty, appears from theſe reaſons.

remarkable deſtruction; how ſtrangely will this repreſent God to men,
whoſe tender mercies are over all his works, to be more cruel then any of his

            <p>THe Apoſtle having in anſwer to the Jews ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond objection
been vindicating Gods rigte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs in juſtifying the heathen by faith,
and har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dening and rejecting the circumciſion for unbelief and diſobedience
to the Goſpel; which anſwer in the two branches of it he had been
proſecuting of by the help of two antient ſayings of God, one to
<hi>Moſes Exo.</hi> 33.19. the other to <hi>Pharaoh, chap.</hi> 9.16. he now
in the verſe before us proceeds to draw up the whole of both into a doctrinal
reſult and concluſion, in theſe words <hi>(ſo then)</hi> or
<hi>therefore he hath mercy on whom he will have mercy, and whom be will be
hardneth:</hi> that is to ſay, it clearly appears from the premiſes, that
God is at liberty and hath unqueſtionable right to make his own terms, up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
which he will ſhew mercy, or upon what terms he will reject: at our firſt
view of theſe words our Apoſtle ſeems to repreſent God in his
proceedings with his creatures as an abſolute monarch, who proceeds and rules
by an arbitrary power, his own will being his law: and ſo tyed to no law nor
con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions; and thus alſo <hi>Daniel</hi> repreſents God, <hi>Dan.</hi>
4.35. <hi>he doth whatever he will in heaven and <pb n="165" facs="tcp:107768:92"/>earth:</hi> and that this is the power of an abſolute Monarch,
appears from what is declared of that great heathen Monarch <hi>Dan.</hi> 5.19.
<hi>whom he would he ſlew, and whom he would he kept alive, whom he would he
ſet up, and whom he would he pulled down;</hi> and this is the character of
that great king and Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narch, <hi>the man of ſin,</hi> of whom we reade
<hi>Dan.</hi> 11. three times over expreſt, <hi>vers.</hi> 3. 16. and 36.
<hi>he ſhall do according to his will:</hi> thus and much more is God
repreſented to do according to his will, <hi>to ſhew mercy to whom he will,
and harden whom he will:</hi> from whence ſome gather perſonal peremptory
and abſolute election and reprobation from his own <hi>will,</hi> without any
law or condition, with reſpect to the creature; but although the Apoſtle
doth thus ſeem to repreſent God as proceeding in mercy and judgment with
his creatures as an abſolute Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narch; yet I ſhall ſhow you wherein there
is an apparent difference between ſuch an arbitrary pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding and the
proceedings of God, though ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to his <hi>will</hi> in five
circumſtances. 
<list>
                  <item>1. God in his proceedings with men cannot <hi>will</hi> or
act any thing but what in it ſelf is righteous, juſt and equal: whereas it
is very incident to men in ſuch a capacity to err, whilſt they rule
according to their will; and therefore it hath been the endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour of all
nations to bound the wills of their Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernours by laws and conditions; men
themſelves being judges, cannot impeach Gods will with any injuſtice or
unequallity: God appeals to men, <hi>Ezek.</hi> 18. <hi>whether his ways were
not juſt and equal;</hi> it was <hi>Abrahams</hi> maxim, <hi>that the judge
of all the earth will do right,</hi> to ſay, that whatever God
<hi>wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth</hi> or acteth, is juſt, is a great truth, and wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy of our
faith, and greatly tends to Gods glory: <pb n="166" facs="tcp:107768:93"/>but to ſay of
things unequal in themſelves, yet done or acted by God, are juſt, is a
great diſho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour to him, Gods will cannot be ſwayed to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juſtice.</item>
                  <item> 2. Gods will differs from mens will, becauſe it admits
of councel, <hi>Ephe.</hi> 1.11. <hi>he doth all things according to the
counſel of his own will.</hi>
                  </item>
                  <item> 3. Gods ruling by his will differs from mens ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling by
their wills; for men in that capacity are un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood to rule by their wills
without a law, but Gods will is formed into a law, both as to his mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy, and
as to his juſtice; therefore we finde little or no difference between Gods
will &amp; Gods law, they are taken one for another in Scripture, to do Gods
word, and to do Gods will is the ſame thing, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the 19th
<hi>verſe</hi> of this <hi>chapter</hi> by ſome is read inſtead of
<hi>who hath reſiſted his will? who hath reſiſted his word?</hi>
                  </item>
                  <item> 4. Men commonly ruling by their will do con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceal their
will, till the time of execution of it, but Gods will is declared before-hand
both to warn on the one hand and encourage on the other.</item>
                  <item> 5. Perſons ruling according to their wills a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt
men, are not ſtedfaſt, they may will one thing to day, and another to
morrow; thoſe who are the ſubjects of their favour or wrath, are not always
the ſame, but Gods will is the ſame to day, to morrow, and for ever; the
ſubjects of Gods fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour and wrath are the ſame yeſterday, to day, and
forever; his will is, that <hi>whoſoever ſeeth the ſon, and believeth in
him ſhould have eternal life:</hi> and this is the ſame ſtill, and his
will is, that <hi>he that re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects the ſon ſhall not ſee life, but the
wrath of God a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bideth on him:</hi> and thus conſidered, God may be ſaid
<hi>to ſhew mercy to whom he will,</hi> yet ſhew mercy <pb n="167" facs="tcp:107768:93"/>to none but ſuch as believe in Jeſus Chriſt: and he may be
ſaid <hi>to harden whom he will;</hi> and yet to har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den none but thoſe who
firſt harden themſelves; for after the ſame manner doth the Apoſtle
ſpeak of the ſpirits diſtributions; he divides to every man ſeverally
as he will, yet upon conditions of cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting and ſeeking of it.</item>
               </list>
            </p>
            <p>But before I proceed, there is a queſtion which I would ſpeak
a few words unto, in order to clear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing our paſſage, that is, why the
Apoſtle rather choſeth to declare, God <hi>ſhewing mercy to whom he
will,</hi> and <hi>hardning whom he will,</hi> then to declare Gods ſhewing
mercy to believers, and hardning impenitent ſinners and rejecters of the
goſpel.</p>
            <p> 
               <list>
                  <item>I anſwer, he ſpeaks after this manner to ſilence the
proud atrogant Jews, who would impoſe up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on God, and teach him whom or what
ſort of peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple he ſhould accept into his favour, and whom he ſhould
reject; theſe Jews had a tincture of proud <hi>Pharaohs</hi> ſpirit, who
thought there was none above him, therefore to humble them, the Apoſtle doth
aſſert Gods abſolute ſupremacy and ſuperintendency over man, he doth
what he will: this was the occaſion of this kinde of ſpeaking at the
firſt, <hi>Exo.</hi> 33.19 to ſilence <hi>Moſes,</hi> who ſeems to be
ſo pertinatiouſly pleading with God for <hi>Iſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rael,</hi> above all the
nations of the world; beſides God takes him off by telling him, <hi>I will
have mercy on whom I will;</hi> in ſhewing mercy, I am not bound to give thee
an account, though thou art my friend <hi>Moſes:</hi> and after this manner
doth <hi>David</hi> take off and ſilence the heathen, who in an undervaluing
way were asking, where was his God? <hi>David</hi> to ſet God out of their
reach, tells them, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 115.3. <hi>our God is in the heavens, he
hath done whatſoever he will,</hi> or pleaſed.</item>
                  <item> 
                     <pb n="168" facs="tcp:107768:94"/>2. He thus ſpeaks, to ſhow that
the law and terms upon which God ſhews mercy to ſome, and hardens ſome,
doth not ariſe from the creatures ſide, but hath the original from
himſelf; it is foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded in the breaſt of God, without the creatures
contrivance or propoſition of the creatures: terms of mercy and terms of
wrath are founded in the breaſt of the moſt high.</item>
                  <item> 3. He thus ſpeaks to magnifie the righteouſneſs of
God, which was a great part of his preſent buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, he that hath an
undeniable right to <hi>ſhow mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy to whom be will,</hi> and <hi>harden whom
he will,</hi> cannot be charged with uurighteouſneſs in his procee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dings,
though he jnſtifie the heathen by faith, and reject the circumciſion for
unbelief and diſobedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence:</item>
               </list>thus the Apoſtle concludes that from Gods hardning
<hi>Pharaoh,</hi> he hath a right to <hi>harden whom he will:</hi> the words
are a concluſion made up of three circumſtances. 
<list>
                  <item>1. That God had an unqueſtionable right to har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den
<hi>Pharaoh,</hi> or elſe it had not been done; that God proceeded rightly
and righteouſly in his pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedings to, and with <hi>Pharaoh.</hi>
                  </item>
                  <item> 2. That God hath the ſame right of power to harden all
ſuch, as <hi>Pharaoh</hi> was, this none can queſtion: he that
righteouſly executes one for murther, may as righteouſly execute a
thouſand being ſuch as he was.</item>
                  <item> 3. It is ſuppoſed in this concluſion, that Gods will
is to harden none but ſuch as <hi>Pharaoh</hi> was, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buſers of his mercy
and long-ſuffering-grace in Chriſt, that is, his will is to harden thoſe,
who firſt harden themſelves:</item>
               </list> I remember what a learned man ſaith upon this head, that
every breach be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween God and the creature, begins firſt on the 
<pb n="169" facs="tcp:107768:94"/>creatures ſide, from the beginning to the end; <hi>God

from eternity, or in time?</item>
                  <item> 5. Was <hi>Pharaohs</hi> hardening by God irreſiſtible
by <hi>Pharaoh,</hi> and irrevocable by God? that is to ſay, was
<hi>Pharaoh</hi> by vertue of Gods hardening his heart ſhut up under an
impoſſibility of obtaining any degree of ſoftneſſe again.</item>

            </p>
            <p>The Anſwer to theſe Five Queſtions will give ſome light to
the paſſage, therefore I ſhall ſpeak a few words to each of them in
order, and chiefly to the third.</p>
            <div type="section">
               <p>1. As to the Mercy here ſpoken of, it muſt needs refer to
the mercy of juſtification and ado<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ption, according to the ſcope of the
Context, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepting perſons upon goſpel-terms, which terms are mercy and
grace; as the Scriptures doth fully ſhew, <hi>Rom.</hi> 11.30,31. where the
Apoſtle three times calls <hi>Juſtification</hi> by the name of
<hi>mercy:</hi> ſo alſo <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 2.4. <hi>God who is rich in
mercy:</hi> after this manner doth the Apoſtle ſpeak to <hi>Titus,
Tit.</hi> 3.5. and 1 <hi>Peter</hi> 1.3. Gods goſpel-proceedings are ways of
mercy: now the terms of this mercy is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trived by God himſelf without the
propoſal of the creature: thus muſt the Apoſtle be here under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood,
where he ſaith, <hi>he hath mercy on whom he will, whether Jews or

ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times <hi>Pharaoh</hi> is ſaid to harden his own heart, and

is metaphorical, alluding, as the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turalliſts <pb n="171" facs="tcp:107768:95"/>tells
us, to ſome elementary bodyes; it is proper to ſteel, ſtones, and ſuch
like bodyes to be hard, and the deſcription of them is by this, they
reſiſt the touch; that which is very hard is known by this, it is not
eaſily penitrated, it very hardly ſuffers an impreſſion, whereby the
figure or out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward ſhape ſuffers alterations; that heart is in like manner
called in Scripture <hi>a hard heart,</hi> that reſiſts the touch, when no

take place upon him: upon this very conſideration is <hi>Pharaoh's</hi> heart
called <hi>a hard heart,</hi> becauſe he reſiſted the touch, when Gods
kinde meſſages came to him, when Gods judgments were upon him they did not
penitrate his heart, his heart did not ſuffer any al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teration or

hardneſſe of heart in men is contrary to Gods nature, therefore not
neceſſitated by him ſo to be: ſee how contrary it was to the nature of
Jeſus Chriſt, of whom it is recorded, <hi>Mark.</hi> 3.5. <hi>he grieved or

firſt, againſt all his applycations and commands, to let his people go: God
never hardens properly, by changing the nature of a ſoft heart into a hard,
this is agreed on all hands.</item>
                     <item> 4. God did not harden <hi>Pharaoh</hi> by any proper

               <p>I might adde further, the means uſed might have humbled
<hi>Pharaoh</hi> and made him to acknowledge the Lord <hi>Jehovah;</hi> as Gods
ſilencing his Magici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans on whom he too much leaned; making them to
confeſſe that in that plague of the <hi>lice,</hi> that it was the finger
of God: as alſo his miraculous diſtinguiſhing the land of
<hi>Goſhen,</hi> where his peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple were from <hi>Egypt:</hi> theſe
particular dealings of God had conviction and ſoftning in the bowels of them;
and we in charity are bound to believe were intended for that end: but it is
objected, did not God tell <hi>Moſes</hi> before he went to <hi>Pharaoh,</hi>
that he would harden <hi>Pharaohs</hi> heart, that he ſhould not let
<hi>Iſrael</hi> go? to which I anſwer. 
<list>
                     <item>In the firſt place I premiſe, that there is much
abuſe of many places of Scripture, in laying too much ſtreſs upon this
word (<hi>ſhall;</hi>) whereas it may, as the learned Gramarians tells us, be
as well read (<hi>will;</hi>) and the truth of this appears from the uſage of
the word <hi>will</hi> as well as <hi>ſhall</hi> in the hiſtory of
<hi>Pharaoh, Exo.</hi> 3.19. <hi>I am ſure that the king of Egypt will not
let you go,</hi> no, not by a mighty hand, and this hardning is elſewhere in
Scripture apply<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed <pb n="175" facs="tcp:107768:97"/>to <hi>Pharaoh</hi> as the agent, 1
Sam. 6.6. <hi>do not you harden your hearts, as</hi> Pharaoh <hi>and the
Egyptians hardened their hearts and would not let</hi> Iſrael <hi>go:</hi>
this was a received Opinion even by the Philiſtins in that day, ſo long
after: that this hardening lay at <hi>Pharaohs</hi> door, not at Gods.</item>
                     <item> 2. In anſwer to this objection God is ſaid to do
many things which are done by him only providen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tially and ſubſequentially;
as for inſtance, Pſa. 105.25. God is ſaid to turn the hearts of the
<hi>Egyptians, to hate his people, and deal ſubtilly with his
ſervants,</hi> and how did God do this? not poſitively but pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>videntially,
<hi>as be bleſſed them with increaſes under their bondage, ſo that they
grew ſtronger then they, vers.</hi> 24. and from hence aroſe their hatred:
and it might as well have occaſioned them to love them, and fall in with
them: how often is this a ground of love? is any thing more uſual then (as we
ſay) to worſhip the riſing ſun, at leaſt to give fained love and
obedience to a ſtrong and prevailing enemie: yet this wrought in them hatred
to them becauſe they were ſo ſtrong; in this ſence God is ſaid to
ſend <hi>Joſeph</hi> into <hi>Egypt Gen.</hi> 45.7.8. and in this ſence
God is ſaid to bid <hi>Shimei</hi> curſe <hi>David,</hi> 2 <hi>Sam.</hi>
16.10. the aſſembly ſaith, it was by a ſecret command of providence;
and in this ſence our Lord is ſaid to come to give diviſion, not peace on
earth; yet di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rectly he brought peace on earth, <hi>Luke</hi> 2.14. thus
Chriſt came to make ſeeing men blind, <hi>John</hi> 9.39. yet to open
blinde eyes: the Scriptures doth often ſpeak of the accidental and
ſubſequent effects of miniſtration; this <hi>Solomon</hi> takes notice
of, <hi>Pro.</hi> 1.32. <hi>the proſperity of fools ſhall deſtroy
them:</hi> whereas proſperity may as well lead to repentance and love to God,
according to what our Apoſtle ſpeaks, <pb n="176" facs="tcp:107768:98"/>
                        <hi>Rom.</hi> 2.

                           <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance:</hi> but we ſee the ſame means may bring forth
different effects, as Chriſt is ſet as well for the fall as the riſing
again of many in <hi>Iſrael, Luke</hi> 2.34. the hardning of <hi>Pharaoh</hi>
by God is not primary and antecedently deſigned by God in his application to
him, but accidentally as I ſhall ſhew you more clearly afterwards.</item>
                     <item> 3. In anſwer to the objection I ſay, that God in
declaring to <hi>Moſes</hi> that he would harden <hi>Pharaoh,</hi>
ſuppoſeth a condition, that is to ſay, that if <hi>Pha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raoh</hi> did not
by all his meſſages and applications to him, at laſt let his people go,
but harden his own heart under all his judgments, ſignes and won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders, that
then at laſt God as a judgment would harden <hi>Pharaohs</hi> heart, ſo as
he ſhould purſue them to his own deſtruction: ſo that though it is
ſaid by God <hi>I will harden</hi> Pharaohs <hi>heart,</hi> yet God did not
do it primarily, nor neceſſarily; neither did the means that God made uſe
of neceſſarily tend to hardning but rather to ſoften.</item>
                  </list>
               </p>
               <p>But then it may be replyed, ſeeing thoſe means uſed by God
to <hi>Pharaoh</hi> had a more pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per tendency to ſoften then harden, why
then did not God as well ſay to <hi>Moſes, I will ſoften</hi> Pharaohs
<hi>heart,</hi> as well as ſay, <hi>I will harden it:</hi> to which I
anſwer, 
<list>
                     <item>that notwithſtanding the proper tendency of thoſe
means, yet God who ſees the end and effects of all means, and cannot be
miſtaken, did foreſee that theſe means would have upon him a contrary
tendency, by reaſon of <hi>Pha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raohs</hi> baſe proud heart: <hi>therefore I
will harden:</hi> a wiſe man may foreſee, that the bright ſhining warm
ſun will make the dunghill ſtink: though the ſame ſun will make the
flower ſmell ſwee<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                        <pb n="177" facs="tcp:107768:98"/>2. God might thus ſay, <hi>I will
harden,</hi> as he had an eye to the end of <hi>Pharaohs</hi> ſtate, for it
was ſo at laſt from God.</item>
                     <item> But 3ly, it is replyed, could not God have ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken ſuch
a courſe with <hi>Pharaoh</hi> as to ſoften him ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectually, and make him
let <hi>Iſrael</hi> go, and ſo pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vented his own ruine? I ſaid
ſomething to the an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer of this before. To which I refer the reader: if we
conſider Gods power regulated by the attri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>butes of his wiſdome, and
righteouſneſs, and juſtice, he did what he could to reduce
<hi>Pharaoh</hi> as he is ſaid in effect to do for his vineyard,
<hi>Eſa.</hi> 5.4. God is not bound to proceed by his abſolute
irre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtable power in converting, nor reſtraining ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners: this
corrupt notion and expectation from God hath been the ground upon which many
have miſcaried: (but thus it is), God hath made man a rational creature,
capable to chooſe the good and refuſe the evil; God laid before
<hi>Pharaoh</hi> life and death; life if he would let <hi>Iſrael</hi> quietly
go, death if he ſtill held them: there <hi>Pharaoh</hi> had his choice of
theſe two, as all men have, where the goſpel comes: this is Gods way,
<hi>Deut.</hi> 30.15. <hi>vers.</hi> 19. and God takes it for granted, that
they have pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er to chooſe; therefore (ſaith he) <hi>chooſe ye:</hi> this
was his proceedings with <hi>Pharaoh:</hi>
                     </item>
                  </list>ſo that in order I ſhall draw up the reſult of this
head. 
<list>
                     <item>1. That God hardned <hi>Pharaohs</hi> heart, that is,
accidentally ſtired up and awakened the baſeneſs of his heart, by
ſending that meſſage to him; <hi>to let</hi> Iſrael <hi>depart his
land,</hi> which was ſo much againſt his proud and covetous intereſt, if
God had been pleaſed that <hi>Iſrael</hi> ſhould ſtill have abode
ſlaves to him, we had not heard nor ſeen the relation of <hi>Pharaohs</hi>
rebellion; as now we do: thus God was <pb n="178" facs="tcp:107768:99"/>concern'd in
hardning <hi>Pharaohs</hi> heart, as he croſt his will by declaring his
own.</item>
                     <item> 2. God accidentally hardened <hi>Pharaohs</hi> heart by
declaring himſelf above him in power, that muſt needs provoke proud
<hi>Pharaoh</hi> to hear of a <hi>Jehovah</hi> above him.</item>
                     <item> 3. God hardened <hi>Pharaohs</hi> heart accidentally by
deferring the full manifeſtation of avenging power, ſo long as he did; this
made <hi>Pharaoh</hi> grow ſtrong, and thought he ſhould yet be able to
deal with him: as <hi>Solomon</hi> ſaith, <hi>Eccleſ.</hi> 8.11.
<hi>becauſe judgment is not ſpeedily executed upon evil doers, their hearts
are fully ſet in them to do evil.</hi> Thus a parent ſometimes can ſay, I
have ſpoyled you by my in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulgence ſhown to you.</item>
                     <item> 4. God hardened <hi>Pharaoh</hi> accidentally by his
condeſcending to remove his judgments ſo ſoon, and at his requeſt, and
that this act of God har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dened his heart you have declared in the hiſtory,
when God had taken off this or that plague: it is as the effect ſaid,
<hi>Pharaoh hardened his heart.</hi>

               <p>I now proceed to the fourth circumſtance, which is more
particularly.</p>
               <p>4. The time of Gods hardning <hi>Pharaoh</hi> poſitive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, for
we muſt needs grant a two-fold hardning of <hi>Pharaohs</hi> heart. 
<list>
                     <item>1. The firſt of which is charged upon himſelf,
<hi>Pharaoh hardened his heart or made his heart ſtrong,</hi> or as ſome
tranſlations reades, <hi>Pharaohs heart har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dened it ſelf:</hi> now this
firſt hardning is from God <pb n="179" facs="tcp:107768:99"/>accidentally, as hath been
ſhown. As he is ſaid to do many things providentially.</item>
                     <item> But 2ly, we have a more ſpecial and more poſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive
hardning which is appropriated to God, he is ſaid to harden <hi>Pharaohs</hi>
heart, not as before ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cidentally but intentionally and judicially; and that
there is ſuch a hardening imputed to God we may ſee in other caſes and
perſons, that God doth ſhut up in and under blindeneſſe and
hardneſſe of heart to their own deſtruction, as the fruit of ſin and
rebellion againſt God: Thus God is ſaid to harden <hi>Sihon</hi> king of
<hi>Heſhbons</hi> heart, made his heart obſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate to his own
deſtruction: ſo alſo it is ſaid of thoſe cities that made war
againſt <hi>Iſrael, Joſhu.</hi> 11,20. God hardened their hearts to their
own de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction and ruine, and many more who were im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediatly hardned by
God.</item>
                  </list>
               </p>
               <p>Now the Queſtion is, when God did thus in ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial harden
<hi>Pharaohs</hi> heart, whether by purpoſe from eternity in the beginning of
the treaty of God with him, or after he had obſtinately ſtouted it out
againſt God a long time. I anſwer, that the Scripture doth no where give us
one word of Gods eternal purpoſe or previous decree, by vertue whereof
<hi>Pharaoh</hi> was neceſſitated to this obdurate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe againſt God:
our enemies will not ſay that, I mean thoſe of them who have writ about
this controverſy; neither did God by any of his deal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings with
<hi>Pharaoh</hi> properly provoke him to be har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dened, but rather had they (as
I have ſhewn you) a tendency to ſoften him: but the proper time of this
judicial hardning <hi>Pharaoh</hi> by God more imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diatly, was after he had
tried him under ſix ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral plagues and their removals under all theſe
ſix judgments: the relation runs thus: <hi>Pharaoh</hi> made 
<pb n="180" facs="tcp:107768:100"/>his heart ſtrong, or <hi>Pharaohs</hi> heart hardened
it ſelf: but after the ſixth plague the ſtile is changed, and
<hi>chap.</hi> 9.12. God is ſaid to harden <hi>Pharaohs</hi> heart: it is
true, that God did betimes, even before <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes</hi> went to
<hi>Pharaoh,</hi> predict this judgement, which afterwards was executed; he did
tell <hi>Moſes, chap.</hi> 4.21. that he would harden <hi>Pharaohs</hi>
heart, that is conditionally, if he firſt hardened his own, and <hi>would not
let his people go:</hi> but this foretelling of it or threatening of it, doth
not prove, that it was immediatly done; it is uſual for God to foretel things
before they come to paſſe; God as well at firſt foretells <hi>Exo.</hi>
3. of <hi>Iſraels borrowing jewels of the Egyptians,</hi> which was the
laſt thing in order to be done, and at firſt he bids <hi>Moſes</hi> tell
<hi>Pharaoh, he would ſlay his firſt-born, chap.</hi> 4.21.22.23. but with
this proviſo, <hi>if he did not let his firſt-born Iſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rael go:</hi> even
ſo he bids <hi>Moſes</hi> to let <hi>Pharaoh</hi> know in like manner, if
he did not let them go, he would harden his heart to his own deſtruction, I
will puniſh his natural and his acquired hardneſſe with judicial
hardneſſe: the ſum of which is to puniſh ſin with ſin; as God
threatens <hi>Ephraim, Hoſe.</hi> 8.11. becauſe he made many altars to
ſin, <hi>altars ſhould be to him for ſin,</hi> that is, God would give up
<hi>Ephraim</hi> to that ſin he delighted; and that is uſual for God to
foretel his judgments before he execute them: ſee concerning the old world,
<hi>Gen.</hi> 6. <hi>an end of all fleſh is before me, I will deſtroy
men:</hi> yet after God had determined to deſtroy men, he waits a 120 years:
ſo as to the deſtruction of <hi>Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruſalem</hi> he gives 40. years to try
them: ſo after he had reſolved conditionally to harden <hi>Pharaoh,</hi> he
ſtays a conſiderable while till he had hardened him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf and rebelled
againſt him with a high hand un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der <pb n="181" facs="tcp:107768:100"/>ſix plagues; and
that the threatning given out <hi>chap.</hi> 4.21. refers to this time and
latter hardening appeareth, if we will conſider <hi>chap.</hi> 8.29. where we
have that ſpecial warning, <hi>ver.</hi> 29. ſuch as we finde not before,
<hi>let not Pharaoh deal deceitfully any more,</hi> implying, that
<hi>Pharaoh</hi> had dealt deceitful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly before, had promiſed and not
performed; and it is emphatically added, <hi>Pharaoh hardened his heart this
time alſo:</hi> Now after theſe ſix plagues, and <hi>Pharaohs</hi> ſix
hardenings on his ſide, we have this emphatical threatning <hi>chap.</hi>
9.14. <hi>I will at this time,</hi> or turn, <hi>pour out all my plagues upon
thy heart,</hi> which ſome underſtand of his hardening by God: ſo that
this ſecond hardening by God is the fruit and effect of his voluntary and
obſtinate hardening himſelf before: Now in ſpeaking to this ſecond
ſort of hardening, it will be needful to enquire in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the difference between
the ſecond and firſt, ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing God is concerned in both, either
accidentally or intentially; it hath already been made plain, that God did
gradually harden <hi>Pharaohs</hi> heart by his former applycations unto him,
but what did God do more now then before to <hi>Pharaoh:</hi> from whence it is
now ſaid, <hi>God hardened his heart,</hi> whereas before it is ſaid,
<hi>Pharaah hardened his own heart?</hi> I anſwer as to the negative part, it
hath been ſpoken unto under the former head, that God doth not do any thing
poſitively, much leſs for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cibly to make the heart hard; neither doth he
in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſe any hardening quallity whereby he hardens ſoft hearts; but that
which we are to underſtand as to matter of fact on Gods ſide is this, that
God doth harden by withdrawing thoſe influences of his ſpirit that ſhould
ſoften; as withdrawing the ſun, makes the earth dark: the Naturalliſts
tells us, <pb n="182" facs="tcp:107768:101"/>that hardening is occaſioned in a natural way
by withdrawing the moiſture out of any body or ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance, whereby it is
condenſt and made hard, and ſtiff and unyeilding to the touch, as the earth
alſo becomes hard like iron, by the withholding its moiſture by
ſhowrs.</p>
               <p>Thus withdrawing of the influences of Gods ſpirit makes the
ſoul dark and hard it ſeems to be ſuppoſed and granted in Scripture,
that the ſpirit of God attends men ordinarily in ſtriving with them, as
they are conſidered in a general ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pacity, by which means they are not ſo
bad as otherwiſe they would be, <hi>Gen.</hi> 6. <hi>my ſpirit ſhall not
always ſtrive with men:</hi> it had ſtrived and would yet ſtrive, but not
always ſtrive: ſo that the wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed old world had this means, <hi>the
ſpirit;</hi> and where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as we reade, <hi>the ſpirit ſhall not always
ſtrive with men;</hi> the greek turns it, <hi>my ſpirit ſhall not always
continue with theſe men:</hi> it was one of the bleſſings that God
beſtowed upon rebellious <hi>Iſrael</hi> a long while in the
wilderneſſe, <hi>that his ſpirit was with them, Nehem.</hi> 9.20. he gave
them his good ſpirit to guide them, till they grieved and rebelled againſt
it: this was the bleſſing which God intruſted <hi>Saul</hi> with,
whilſt he was obedient, 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 16.14. but upon his diſobedience
God took his ſpirit from him, and an evil ſpirit came on him in the room of
it: wicked men are attended with good motions of the ſpirit, but for great
ſins God ſometimes withdraws it from them; and this withdrawing is called
giving up perſons: ſee that eminent place, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 81.11.12.
<hi>they would not hearken ſo he gave them up,</hi> or as
<hi>Ainſworth</hi> reades, <hi>he lot them go away in the perverſeneſſe
of their own hearts: or to walk in their own counſels:</hi> this was
<hi>Pharaohs</hi> caſe, <pb n="183" facs="tcp:107768:101"/>he had grieved, quenched,
rebelled againſt the motions of Gods ſpirit, which had ſeveral times
inſtigated him to be willing to let <hi>Iſrael</hi> go: Now he is given up
to follow his own will and counſel without controul: <hi>I will purſue, I
will overtake, I will divide the ſpoil:</hi> Thus God is ſaid to do with
thoſe wicked perſons of which we reade, <hi>Ro.</hi> 1.24. <hi>God gave
them up,</hi> he would poſſeſs them no longer: now the fruits and effects
of his giving up or with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drawing the ſpirit, is very dreadful.</p>
               <p> 
                  <list>
                     <item>As firſt, the fruits of it is a heavineſſe and
fat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of heart, a very great indiſpoſedneſſe of heart to hear
what God or his ſervants ſhall ſpeak to them for their own good: this was
the caſe with <hi>Elies</hi> ſons for their horrible ſin in cauſing
Gods or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinances and ſacrifices to ſtink, 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 2.25. <hi>they
hearkened not to their fathers inſtructions, becauſe the Lord would ſlay
them:</hi> God as a judgment had ſhut their hearts from hearing: ſuch an
effect we reade of to <hi>Rehoboham,</hi> 1 <hi>Kings</hi> 12.15. he had no
diſpoſition to take the councel of the old men which would have been his
ſafety, but the young mens to his own ruine: ſuch an inſtance we have
<hi>Deut.</hi> 2.30. therefore <hi>Pharaohs hardening his heart,</hi> and
<hi>not hearkening,</hi> are put together all along.</item>
                     <item> The ſecond effect of this judicial act of God, is an
implacable hatred to Gods moſt faithful ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants, who ſeeks their
ſouls good: when <hi>Saul</hi> had loſt the ſpirit of God, and the evil
ſpirit was upon him, he fought to kill <hi>David,</hi> whom he was forced to
ſay, <hi>was more righteous then he,</hi> 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 16.17. cha. 8.11.
<hi>Saul caſt a javelin at him,</hi> with a deſigne to kill him, whilſt
he was pleaſing him with his muſick: it is conſiderable that after this
hardning of <hi>Pharaoh, Ex.</hi> 10.28. he forbids <hi>Moſes</hi> to come
any more into <pb n="184" facs="tcp:107768:102"/>his preſence upon pain of death;

                     <item> 3. Such a perſon hath no ſence of ſin when
com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted: a judicial hardned ſinner is inſenſible, whereas a
true-hearted perſon is ſenſible of the leaſt ſin, and hath checks in
his conſcience upon that account: the Apoſtle ſpeaks of ſome 1
<hi>Tim.</hi> 4.2. <hi>who have their conſciences ſeared with a hot
iron,</hi> and to the <hi>Epheſ. chap.</hi> 4.18. the Apoſtle ſpeaks of
ſome, <hi>that are paſt feeling:</hi> a hardned ſoul is under the
withdrawings of Gods ſpirit, is inſenſible of ſin, therefore the author
to the Hebrews, exhorts them <hi>to have a care,</hi> and uſe the means to
<hi>perſerve them from being hardned by the deceitfulneſs of ſin,
Heb.</hi> 3. <hi>Rom.</hi> 1. is full to this purpoſe.</item>
                     <item> 4. Perſons thus withdrawn from, are delivered up to
themſelves, do much abuſe Gods mercies; all the mercy of God to ſuch a
perſon doth further harden him in order to his own deſtruction: thus it was
with <hi>Pharaoh,</hi> and ſuch we reade of <hi>Rom.</hi> 2. who are
impenitent, who take advantage thereby to <hi>treaſure up wrath againſt the
day of wrath:</hi> all the mercies of God to <hi>Iſrael</hi> after his
withdrawing himſelf from them, ſtill hardned them more and more, even
thoſe 40. years that God waited upon them.</item>
                     <item> 5. Such withdrawings or deliverings up is fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed with
a ſtupid blindneſs in their underſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dings, that they cannot foreſee
their own danger that waits for them: thus it was with <hi>Pharaoh, Exo.</hi>
14.4. <hi>I will harden</hi> Pharaoh <hi>that he ſhall pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſue</hi> he
ſees, nor feareth no danger, but on the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary <pb n="185" facs="tcp:107768:102"/>promiſeth himſelf to overtake and divide the ſpoyl: ſo it was
with thoſe cities, <hi>Ioſhua</hi> 11.20. <hi>it was of the Lord to harden
their hearts, that they ſhould come againſt</hi> Iſrael <hi>in battel,
that he might deſtroy them utterly;</hi> yet this they could not ſee, their
own ruine was hidden from their eyes: ſo it was with the Jews, whilſt under
this ſtate, <hi>Rom.</hi> 11.7,8,9,10. they were blinded, according to
<hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vids</hi> imprecation: the ſame word is uſed for hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning and
blinding:</item>
                  </list> theſe and many more are the ſad effects of Gods
withdrawing his ſpirit, and the influences thereof, and it may well be ſaid
in this caſe as God ſpeaks to <hi>Iſrael, Hoſe.</hi> 9.12. <hi>yea, wo
be to that perſon from whom I depart,</hi> the truth of it is, the heart of
man is ſo bad and ill inclined, that God needs do no more then give him up to
his own heart: and he will ſoon act all wickedneſs with greedineſs
<hi>Act.</hi> 7.42, when God gives <hi>Iſrael</hi> up, they preſently
worſhip the hoſt of heaven; this conſidered we may well allow of it as a
choice mercy, namely reſtraining grace; for by this means men are not ſo
bad to themſelves or others as they would be: if God do but ſay to
<hi>Ephraim, let him alone,</hi> he will be bad enough, <hi>Hoſe.</hi> 4. if
God let a ſoul alone, it will undo it ſelf to all eternity. <hi>David</hi>
ſeems to intimate by his prayer and expo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtulation with God,
<hi>Pſal.</hi> 51. that the foundation of his groſs falling, was not only
the inclination of his nature in which he was concerned, but the withdrawing
Gods ſpirit and the influences there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of in him, which makes him ſo
ſtrongly requeſt, that God would not again <hi>take his holy ſpirit from
him,</hi> but uphold him or ſuſtain him with his ſpirit: he is
ſenſible, that there lay his defect before: Now it is remarkable; and the
conſideration of it <pb n="186" facs="tcp:107768:103"/>is much for our inſtruction, that
this withdrawing the ſpirit of God, and the influences thereof, was never the
portion of any, but as the fruit aad ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect of great diſobedience to the
motions of Gods ſpirit within, and the word without: any body will readily
grant this a truth, as to <hi>Pharaohs</hi> caſe; God takes great pains with
him before he delive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red him up to this hardening, and it is as clear
concerning the Jews, <hi>Chriſt would have gathered them as a hen gatheneth
her chickens under her wing, but they would not, Mat.</hi> 23. and that this
deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vering up is no other then the fruit and effects of provoking ſin and
diſobedience, ſee theſe places following, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 81.11. <hi>but
my people would not harken to my voice,</hi> Iſrael <hi>would have none of
me: ſo I gave them up to the hardneſs of their hearts,</hi> or <hi>their
hearts luſts: Act.</hi> 7.42. after the children of <hi>Iſrael</hi> had
made a calf, ahd thereby greatly provo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked God to anger, and this after God had
newly delivered them with a high hand out of <hi>Egypt,</hi> and brought them
thorow the Red-ſea, <hi>then God turned and gave them up:</hi> ſee
<hi>Rom.</hi> 1.24. <hi>therefore God gave them up:</hi> ſee <hi>verſe</hi>
26. <hi>for this cauſe God gave them up. So Ephraim is given to Idols,</hi>
therefore God lets him alone: when perſons ſin againſt light, it is the
ready way to forfeit their light: this was the caſe with the Jews, their
mallice was ſo great a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt Chriſt, that they contrary to their own
rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon and experience, accuſe him of <hi>caſting out de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vils by Belzebub
the prince of Devils;</hi> notwithſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing their children muſt caſt them
out by the name of Jeſus: after this, Chriſt ſpeaks to them in pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rables,
to the end they might not ſee or under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand, to fulfill the prophefy of
<hi>Eſaiah, chap.</hi> 6. re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cited, <hi>Mat.</hi> 13. the ground of Gods
ſhuting their <pb n="187" facs="tcp:107768:103"/>eyes, and blinding and hardning their
hearts, was but the effects of their firſt ſhutting their own eyes and
ears, as you may reade, <hi>Act.</hi> 28.27. <hi>Solomon</hi> ſaith,
<hi>Pro.</hi> 29.1. <hi>he that being often reproved har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dens his neck, ſhall
ſuddenly be deſtroyed,</hi> and that without remedy: all that hath been
added, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firms the truth of the fourth head, that Gods har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dening
<hi>Pharaohs</hi> heart, was Gods judicial act up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on <hi>Pharaohs</hi> hardning
his own heart, under the firſt ſix plagues, and ſo we have done with the
fourth particular.</p>
            </div>
            <div type="section">
               <p n="5">We now proceed to the fifth and laſt circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance to
be ſpoken unto, by way of explication, which is this, whether this ſecond
hardning is un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>avoidable in its approach, or irrecoverable when under it? I
ſhall ſpeak a few words to both theſe particulars.</p>
               <p n="1">And to the firſt, I anſwer that God even in this his
approach to harden in judgment, is very wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling to be hindered by the
creatures meeting him by humiliation and compliance: this appears even in this
ſecond hardning of <hi>Pharaoh;</hi> though God is ſaid to harden his
heart, yet ſtill his further pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedings are conditional, as appears,
<hi>Exo.</hi> 10.4. <hi>if thou refuſe to humble thy ſelf, and let</hi>
Iſrael <hi>go, then I will proceed:</hi> now if <hi>Pharaoh</hi> had been
ſhut up in &amp; under an impoſſibillity of relenting and humbling, then
this had not been propounded as a <hi>Medium:</hi> for it had been rather to
have inſulted over <hi>Pharaoh</hi> in this his deplorable condition. to have
ſtirred him up to do that which he was in no poſſibility to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form,
which men are not uſually found to do: if I ſhall ſee a perſon in an
invincible ſtrong place, from whence he cannot get out, and then make him
promiſes upon condition of his coming out; <pb n="188" facs="tcp:107768:104"/>what is this
but to inſult over his bondage? which God doth not do: if God invites
<hi>Pharaoh</hi> to let <hi>Iſrael</hi> go upon promiſe of impunity, he
well knows it was in his power yet to let them go, though not ſo eaſily as
he could at firſt invitation, becauſe every act of rebellion makes the
heart yet harder and harder: therefore God promiſeth <hi>Pharaoh,</hi> if he
would yet now at laſt let <hi>Iſrael</hi> go, he would not bring the
locuſts, or any other plague; we reade that the worſt and moſt rebellious
of mankinde are ſtill ſent unto by God; who could be worſe then the old
world, for whom God was grieved at the heart, and <hi>repented that he made
man?</hi> yet he <hi>ſtrives</hi> with them by his ſpirit in the miniſtry
of <hi>Noah</hi> a 120. years: ſo alſo 2 <hi>Cron.</hi> 36.15. he had
compaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion after all that hardneſs contracted by them, as appears by
their abuſing his prophets, ſee <hi>Ezek.</hi> 12. we there reade of a
<hi>rebellious houſe;</hi> who had hardened themſelves to a high degree,
having eyes and ſee not, ears and hear not, yet ſtill God uſeth means
with them; and that with this proviſo, <hi>ver.</hi> 13. it may be they will
conſider though they be a rebellious houſe, God knew that they were not in
an incapacity to conſider and return; ſuch a hardened people are not
debarred of means of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſideration, the wicked old world were in a capacity
of returning to the laſt moment of the 120. years ſo long as the patience
of God waited: God waited after he is ſaid to harden <hi>Pharaohs</hi> heart
under four judgements more to provoke him to prevent his utter deſtruction:
and beſides all this, it appears, <hi>Pharaoh</hi> was not put into an
incapacity to repent, becauſe after all this hardning he did repent, though
it did not hold with him <hi>chap.</hi> 9.27. (ſaith he) God is righteous, I
and my people are wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed; <pb n="189" facs="tcp:107768:104"/>and however ſome may judge
of this repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance, had it been continued in and not repented of, it would
have ſaved <hi>Pharaoh</hi> from deſtruction: ſo again <hi>cha.</hi>
10.16. <hi>I have ſinned againſt the Lord and againſt you;</hi> So that
God did not harden <hi>Pharaoh</hi> irrecoverably, ſo as that it was
impoſſible for him to repent: neither was <hi>Iſrael</hi> ſo ſhut up
after the death of Chriſt, but that they might ſtill repent; for we reade
of three thouſand of them who were guilty of that great ſin of killing
Chriſt, conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted in one day, <hi>Acts.</hi> 2. by <hi>Peters</hi> ſermon:
and that they are not irrecoverably ſhut up by vertue of that ſentence, and
that hardening and blinding judicially by God is granted of all ſides: for
they ſhall yet in time have ſoft relenting hearts given them, and their
blinding and hardening is but tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poral: the firſt prophecy of it
<hi>Eſa.</hi> 6. had in it an <hi>(until)</hi> and <hi>Rom.</hi> 11. they
ſhall be grafted in again; if they abide not ſtill, in unbelief; and this
muſt needs follow, unleſſe we grant, that <hi>Pharaoh</hi> or the Jews
had committed that unpardonable ſin, which I ſuppoſe none will ſay: if
this be ſo, then let us take up this conſideration by the way, that if
<hi>Pharaohs</hi> hardening was not irreſiſtible nor irre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coverable, how
can <hi>Pharaohs</hi> hardening be a meet type of abſolute perſonal
irrecoverable reprobati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on? except you will plead for a perſonal conditio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal
reprobation, ſeeing all theſe threatnings againſt <hi>Pharaoh</hi> are
conditional, if he do not repent to let <hi>Iſrael</hi> go.</p>
               <p n="2">2. He was in a capacity to repent even under the worſt
hardening till his utter deſtruction; ſo that <hi>Pharaohs</hi> caſe will

be a poſſibility to withſtand it or reco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver out of it, yet know, it is
unſpeakable hard, next to an impoſſibility, as it muſt needs follow:
for every act of impiety doth ſtill harden more and more: it was very hard
for <hi>Pharaoh</hi> to attain to that degree of relenting which he did attain
unto, but yet more hard to keep it upon his heart: cuſtome in ſin begets a
ſecond nature: ſee 13. <hi>Jer.</hi> 23. <hi>can the Ethiopian change his
skin, or the leopard his ſpots? no more can they learn to do good who are
accuſtomed to do evil.</hi>

                  </list> that which yet remains in order to a cloſe of the 17.

               <p>1. From verſe. 17. <hi>for the Scripture ſaith unto
Pharaoh,</hi> from this preface this Doctrine offers it ſelf to our
conſideration. 
<q>1. Doctrine, <hi>That the ſayings of God are not leſs
divine or authoritative, becauſe they are written.</hi>
                  </q>
               </p>
               <p>The writing of Gods ſayings doth not take away from them
divine authority, but they are as if God had ſpoken them at preſent by his
own mouth; The Apoſtle might as well have ſaid, God ſaith unto
<hi>Pharaoh,</hi> yet he chooſeth to ſay, <hi>the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
ſaith.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>This Doctrine is very well worth our conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in this
day in which we are fallen; but I ſhall but briefly touch it, becauſe I
ſpoke ſomething to it in the explication: it is plain theſe words were
ſpoken by God, <hi>Exo.</hi> 9. yet the Apoſtle referreth us to the
Scripture; and this is uſual with the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle in other places: ſee
<hi>Gal.</hi> 4. <hi>the Scriptures ſaith, caſt out the bond woman,</hi>
though God ſpake it: ſo 1. Timo. 5.18. <hi>the Scripture ſaith, thou
ſhalt not muzzel the mouth of the oxe,</hi> whereas God ſpake it; So that
to ſay <hi>the Scripture ſaith,</hi> and to ſay, <hi>God 
<pb n="192" facs="tcp:107768:106"/>ſaith,</hi> are the ſame; and indeed, why ſhould
any body queſtion the truth of this doctrine? are the ſayings of Kings and
Monarchs of leſſe authority becauſe they are written and made into a law?
ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly men appropriates that to the Scriptures that is proper to God himſelf,

               <p>From hence we may note.

                     <item>1. That thoſe that ſlight and undervalue the
Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptures are not guided by the ſame ſpirit that the Apoſtle
<hi>Paul</hi> was: there are ſome that will cry up Gods ſpeakings, yet
undervalue the Scriptures; nay, preferring revelations and imaginary
ſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings of God before the Scriptures: Holy St. <hi>Peter,</hi> who we are
ſure was guided by Gods ſpirit was of another minde; who exalts the
Scriptures above the real ſpeaking of God to him in the mount, <hi>and calls
the Scriptures a more ſure word of the prophets.</hi>

               </q>
               <p>Though it is in Gods power to force, compel and cruſh them,
yet he chooſeth to treat with them; and invite them by his ſayings to
obedience this is a truth from the beginning, even with <hi>Adam</hi> in 
<pb n="193" facs="tcp:107768:106"/>the garden, when he had ſinned and forfeited his life,
without a word to be ſpoken to him, yet God reaſons or words it with him;
and this is Gods way all along to <hi>Saul,</hi> to <hi>David,</hi> to
<hi>Solomon,</hi> to the <hi>Jews:</hi> God is ſpeaking before ſtriking,
but I ſhall ſay no more to this.</p>
               <q>3. Doctrine, which is more general from the text; <hi>That God

them, when they abuſe his firſt-born: this is the very ground of Gods
ſending <hi>Moſes</hi> to <hi>Pharaoh;</hi> he had a perfect and deep
ſence of their afflictions, <hi>I have ſeen, I have ſeen,</hi> (ſaith
God) <hi>their afflictions:</hi> it is recorded <hi>Judges</hi> 10.16. <hi>that
his ſoul was grieved for the afflictions of his people:</hi> this is the
cauſe pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounded why he ſends to the nations, <hi>Zecha.</hi> 2.8.
becauſe they had been afflicting his people who were as dear to him as the
apple of his eye; and ſo we have it, <hi>Eſa.</hi> 63.9. where he ſpeaks
of this ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry affliction; if we obſerve the context, <hi>in all their
afflictions he was afflicted with them:</hi> God hath a ſim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pathy with them
in their afflictions: it is as if he had afflicted himſelf: it is true, God
many times ſeems as if he did not regard the afflictions of his people: he
bears long with their enemies, as in this oppreſſion in <hi>Egypt;</hi> he
ſuffered them <hi>to be e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil intreated</hi> 400. years, <hi>Act.</hi> 7.6.
as afterwards he ſuffers them to be afflicted 70. years in <hi>Babylon,</hi>
yet this is not becauſe he did not perfectly ſee and <pb n="194" facs="tcp:107768:107"/>take notice; but becauſe God hath a work to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form both upon his

judgments to bring forth upon the nations, upon this very account, for
afflicting and oppreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing his firſt-born: in ſpecial upon

               </p>
               <p>Gods very purpoſe in reprieving of <hi>Pharaoh</hi> ſix

place the foot of his proceeding in wrath upon his kinde and deliberate treatys

               </p>
               <p>And the Apoſtle doth intend no leſſe in laying this

            <p>WE have contained in this verſe, the Jews quarrelſome
replycation by way of Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject, againſt what had been aſſerted by the
Apoſtle in theſe four following verſes: we have the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles ſevere
and pathetical reply in two parts. 
<list>
                  <item>1. A ſharp reproof.</item>
                  <item>2ly, A ſubſtantial vindication of the
righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe and wiſe proceedings of God with mankinde;</item>
               </list> both which the Objection ſeems to impeach. But I ſhall
firſt ſpeak unto the 19. <hi>verſe</hi> before us, in which we have the
Objection framed, either as the Apoſtle framed it himſelf, or as they
themſelves made it: ſome think the Apoſtle fra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med it himſelf as
perſonating the Jews in it: the riſe of this Objection may be ſuppoſed
to be from what the Apoſtle had been lately aſſerting concerning the
power and prerogative of God, in juſtifying and hardning men at his own will:
ſome think that from the Inſtance of <hi>Pharooh,</hi> and the concluſion
drawn thereupon, <hi>that God hardens whom he will;</hi> from thence the Jews
apprehended them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves ſome of thoſe ſubjects of his will to harden:
thereupon their ſpirits were inraged againſt the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtle his doctrine
and God himſelf; and that what we have in this 119 <hi>ver.</hi> is the fruit
&amp; effect there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of; <pb n="204" facs="tcp:107768:112"/>they are ready to impeach S.
<hi>Pauls</hi> Doctrine as if he had not repreſented God conſiſtent with
himſelf, whilſt he had ſhut them up in hardneſſe and blindeneſs,
irreſiſtably, aad yet haveing ſo done, complained or found fault with
them, and blamed them, who are under ſuch a kinde of neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſity by a
decree of his own will.</p>
            <p>The words themſelves are preſented as a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſe object or
reply againſt God; in which we have theſe four parts conſiderable. 
<list>
                  <item>1. The objector or perſon objecting, expreſt in the
ſingular particle <hi>thou.</hi>
                  </item>
                  <item> 2. The perſon unto whom this objection is di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rected;
<hi>unto me</hi> ſaith S. <hi>Paul.</hi>
                  </item>
                  <item> 3. The Subject objected againſt, <hi>why doth he finde
fault?</hi>
                  </item>
                  <item>4. The abſurdity it, ſelf imputed to God, <hi>for who
hath reſiſted his will?</hi>
                  </item>
               </list> this objection ſome think is drawn from the paſſage
of <hi>Pharaoh, Exo.</hi> 9.17. that God ſeems to complain of
<hi>Pharaoh</hi> after he was hardened by God, and there is a co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lourable
ground alſo as to the Jews, that after they were hardned and blinded by God,
he yet blames them: and the foundation of this Objection is from a rational
principle, that thoſe perſons are not to be complained of, who are
determined by an ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolute decree or will of God, as they ſuppoſed
<hi>Pharaoh</hi> and themſelves were, according to the Apoſtles Doctrine?
It is the principle of wiſe-men that perſons are excuſable who are
neceſſitated by a greater power then their own to be what they are: The
Apoſtle in theſe words doth not perſonate an humble conſciencious
perſon modeſtly deſirous of ſatisfaction, with a ſpirit of
meekneſſe in things wherein they are dark: But as an impatient men 
<pb n="205" facs="tcp:107768:112"/>in hearing the truth, when the light thereof ſhi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth
into his conſcience, to diſcover his naked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe: and further we may
perceive by the form of the Objection, that it doth diſcover a confident
in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſulting ſpirit in the objector, as alſo much haugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyneſſe in the
face of it; he finds fault with God for finding fault: but to come more
cloſely and diſtinctly to the words themſelves, by way of ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plication;
as I have proceeded in the former ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, ſo I ſhall enquire
diſtinctly into theſe words, and that under theſe ſix conſiderations.

<list>
                  <item>1. I ſhall enquire into the reading of the words.</item>
                  <item> 2. I ſhall enquire what ſort of perſons may be
ſuppoſed to make this quarrelſome Objection or reply?</item>
                  <item> 3. From what part of S. <hi>Pauls</hi> Doctrine this
Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection is raiſed?</item>
                  <item> 4. What are we to underſtand by Gods finding

with?</item>
                  <item> 6. What is this will which the objecter ſuppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth to
be irriſiſtable in God?</item>
               </list>
            </p>
            <p>Of each of theſe a few words in order.</p>
            <p n="1">And 1. As to the reading of the words, moſt in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpreters
reads them as they are here read, yet I meet with a ſecond reading which runs
thus, why doth he finde fault who hath diſobeyed his law? and there may be a
good colour for ſuch a reading from the conſideration of that affirmity
that is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween Gods <hi>will</hi> and Gods <hi>law</hi> or <hi>word,</hi>
they are taken one from another; ſee <hi>John.</hi> 7.17. <hi>he that doth my
will ſhall know of my doctrine:</hi> by which will is to be underſtood his
word, and thoſe who thus reade the words, do thus paraphraſe upon 
<pb n="206" facs="tcp:107768:113"/>them: why is he ſo angry with us: and reſolved ſo
ſeverely to deal with us, who are ſo far from refuſing obedience to his
law, that it is only out zeal for the law that makes us reject your
Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an religion? And to make this reading more plain they proceed alſo
upon the 20 verſe: thus from S. <hi>Pauls</hi> reproof you may be aſhamed
of your ſaucy and prophane arguing: for may not God your creator impoſe
what law he pleaſe upon you? is he bound never to abrogate that law given by
<hi>Moſes?</hi> and cannot he give you another law, and require obedience to
that? and for your non-obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience to that law, deal with you, as the potter
with his clay, that marreth in his hand and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth you veſſels of
diſhonour? and this parra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phraſe ſeems to have ſome colour of truth in
it. But I rather incline to the common reading before us, foraſmuch as the
words ſo read, well agree with the Original and the Context.</p>
            <p n="2">The ſecond thing that I am to enquire into, is the
perſons propounding this quarrelſome objecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on: it is here propounded in
the ſingular <hi>thou:</hi> ſome are of opinion that the Apoſtle did not
really and in matter of fact meet with ſuch an Objection; but perceiving the
ſpirit of the Jews his Antago<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſts did ſhape it out accordingly; by way
of an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticipation; and ſo applycable to any at any time who ſhould make
ſuch an objection; but it rather ſeems by the anſwer, that there was
ſuch an Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection really made, unleſſe we ſhould ſuppoſe the
Apoſtle is making a man of ſtraw, and then fighting againſt it: for his
anſwer ſeems to be di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rected to a real Antagoniſt; and that the perſons
he replyed unto, were the blinded obſtinate rebel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lious Jews is plain enough;
they being the people <pb n="207" facs="tcp:107768:113"/>he now was concerned with in this
Epiſtle and chapter, unto whom in particular he did direct his ſpeech,
under the ſame appellation, as in the reply to the Objection: ſee
<hi>chap.</hi> 2. <hi>O man!</hi> which <hi>O man</hi> is underſtood the
Jews; ſee <hi>chap.</hi> 2. <hi>ver.</hi> 17. <hi>thou art called a Jew:</hi>
So when the Apoſtle ſpeaks under the ſame appellation, <hi>O man!</hi> he
means the Jews ſee <hi>ver.</hi> 20. and we may eaſily perceive, that they
were the people intended, by conſidering their temper and ſpirit: we reade
of no people in all the book of God, ſo perverſe ſpirited as they, even
againſt God himſelf, in all ages: what cauſe God had to complain of them
all along: their fathers are ſaid <hi>to ſpeak againſt</hi> God,
<hi>Pſal.</hi> 78.19. It is no new thing for them to quarrel and ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pitulate
with God: ſee how God complains of the ſame people, <hi>Mala.</hi> 2.17.
<hi>ye have wearied me by your words, yet you ſay wherein have we wearied
thee?</hi> ſo <hi>Mal.</hi> 3.13. <hi>your words have been ſtout a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt
me, ſaith the Lord; yet ye ſay, what have we ſo much ſpoken againſt
thee?</hi> thus they diſpute with God; and the ſame ſpirit appeared in
this gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration, in Chriſts time; ſee how he repreſents them in the
parable murmuring againſt God, <hi>Mat.</hi> 20.11. not allowing him to do
what he will with his own: and ſuch a ſpirit our Apoſtle met with from
them, <hi>Act.</hi> 13.45. when he had preached the goſpel to them (in love
to their ſouls) they were filled with envy, yea they contradicted and
blaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phemed at the doctrine of the goſpel: ſo that what we have in our
text is no new thing with them, they were much deſtitute of the fear of God,
and a humble ſpirit. Some would here have it thus, that S. <hi>Paul</hi> had
been in this diſcourſe managing the Calviniſts opinion of abſolute
election and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prebation, <pb n="208" facs="tcp:107768:114"/>and that the Jews like
<hi>Lutherans</hi> (or free-willers) doth reply and cavil thereat; to whom the
Apoſtle takes pains to convince, <hi>vers.</hi> 20, 21, 22, 23. and indeed at
the firſt view it ſeems to ſound that way; but upon examination of the
A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtles reply throughout in the four following verſes, it will clearly
appear otherways.</p>
            <p n="3">The third particular to be enquired into is, from what part
of the precedent doctrine of the Apoſtle is this objection raiſed? it is
the general received opinion on both ſides, from all that I have reade, that
I can remember, that this objection is drawn from the cloſe of the former
verſe, <hi>(whom he will he hardeneth):</hi> and that which occaſions
perſons ſo to judge, is from theſe two relative particles in this
verſe; as the particle <hi>then</hi> or <hi>therefore; thou wilt ſay
then,</hi> as alſo the particle <hi>yet why doth he</hi> yet <hi>find
fault?</hi> notwithſtanding what hath been ſaid before, and that the
objection is raiſed, from that verſe appeareth from hence, that he keeps
the ſame ſtile, <hi>who hath reſiſted his will?</hi> ſo that it is
probable, that the objector had his eye upon the cloſe of that verſe, and
indeed the very voyce of this verſe doth diſcover it to be begotten of the
former; and the objection argues thus: we are hardened by his will and
pleaſure, and yet he finds fault and up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braids us for not believing in your
Jeſus, notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding we are ſhut up by an abſolute decree; for his
will and counſell muſt ſtand: and if we ſhould now believe, it were to
no purpoſe, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing concluded in his will: thus the Objection ſeems to argue
from the Apoſtles words going before.</p>
            <p n="4">4. What may we underſtand by Gods finding fault? the word
in the greek is to complain or re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prove, <pb n="209" facs="tcp:107768:114"/>not to puniſh
or reprobate, as ſome ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin it is ſuppoſed; that God doth complain of
and reprove thoſe hardned by him: <hi>Pharaoh</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing hardened by God is
yet complained of by God, for God to finde fault according to the context,
ſeems to contain a threatning deſtruction upon thoſe he ſo complains
of; ſometimes for God to complain of or finde fault, is to mourn over a
peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, as he did over <hi>Iſrael, Why will you die, O houſe O
Iſrael?</hi> and this kinde of complaint is uſed by God in both Old and New
Teſtament: Chriſt <hi>weeps over Ieruſalem</hi> in his complaint for
them: ſo that for God to find fault or complain, is to mourn and bewail for a
perſon or peoples deſtruction, and the cauſe of it.</p>
            <p n="5">5. What is it that God findes fault with and complains of in
them? I anſwer, the great evil that God complains of in his people is their
unbe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lief &amp; diſobedience, <hi>becauſe they believed not on his onely
begotten ſon Jeſus Chriſt;</hi> all the threatenings and complaints
againſt the Jews was for their diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>obedience to and rejecting of Jeſus
Chriſt.</p>
            <p n="6">But that circumſtance moſt needfull to be enqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed into,
is about this will of God which the ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection ſeems to render
irreſiſtable; <hi>who hath reſiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed his will?</hi> the whole ground of
this objection ſeems to be laid here, that it is not reaſonable to finde
fault, or blame the Jews who are neceſſita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted by Gods will to be what they
are; the great queſtion is, what will of God is intended here which none are
able to reſiſt? for the words muſt be underſtood, <hi>who hath been
able to reſiſt his will?</hi>
            </p>
            <p> 
               <list>
                  <item>I anſwer firſt, it cannot be underſtood of Gods
preceptory will, the will of his commandments, <pb n="210" facs="tcp:107768:115"/>for that
will of God hath been reſiſted by ſome, even from the beginning of the
world to this day: <hi>Adam</hi> in paradice reſiſted that will, and ſo
do all men more or leſſe, as the Apoſtle <hi>Iames</hi> ſaith, <hi>in
many things we offend all:</hi> and it might have been as properly if not more
properly ſaid, <hi>who hath not reſiſted his will?</hi> and many have
reſiſted his ſpirit alſo: Act. 7.</item>
                  <item> 2. Suppoſe we underſtand it of Gods decreeing will,
then it runs thus, who ever did or can hinder the coming to paſs of that
which God hath pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed the coming to paſs? what he hath purpoſed
ſhall come to paſs, and take place againſt all inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veniences
whatſoever; and if it be taken ſo, what then will appear in this objection
to croſs what the Apoſtle had ſaid in the premiſes, <hi>who hath
reſiſted his will?</hi> that is, his abſolute will, without con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions
expreſt or implyed:</item>
               </list>there are two de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crees of God (as I have ſaid before) that
none can reſiſt, nether men nor Angels. 
<list>
                  <item>1. That believers in Chriſt, ſo continuing to the end,
ſhall be ſaved.</item>
                  <item>2. Such as diſobey the Goſpel, and ſo live and dye,
ſhall be damned;</item>
               </list> this will of God is irreſiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able; but that thoſe who
are now unbelievers and hard-hearted perſons may by the help and grace of God
be recovered, is very poſſible; for we do not read of any ſuch hardening
of God, as doth leave men for ever in and under an impoſſibillity of
returning: this was neither the ſtate of <hi>Pharaoh</hi> nor the Jews (as
you have heard;) ſo that theſe circumſtances conſidered, the preſent
obiection in our text ſeems to be but an irrationall quarrelſome reply,
contrary to their own reaſon and experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, like unto that quarrell with
our Saviour, <pb n="211" facs="tcp:107768:115"/>
               <hi>Matt.</hi> 12.24. when they charge him
with <hi>caſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing out divils by Beelzebub the prince of divils;</hi> when as
their children muſt caſt them out by the name of Jeſus: and that this
obiection doth favour of ſuch a ſpirit, captious and quarrelſome,
deſigning only to undervalue Gods proceedings, and to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parage the
Apoſtles doctrine, will very clearly apear in our further traverſing the
Apoſtles anſwer thereunto, the anſwer doth clearly demonſtrate, that
theſe words proceeded from a baſe and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worthy ſpirit, tending to the
diſparaging Gods power and Supremacy over Jews and gentiles, which the
Apoſtle had been before aſſerting, both as to his ſhowing mercy and as
to his hardening: but I ſhall be very brief as to this verſe, becauſe I
ſhall have more properly occaſion to demonſtrat the nature of this
objection, in the anſwers fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing, in verſes 20, 21, 22, 23.</p>
            <p>That only which I ſhall do in order to the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluſion of this
19. verſe, is only to preſent you with thoſe doctrinall concluſions
that ariſeth from the words thus opened: which are as follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth,</p>
            <p>Firſt, From the nature of the Apoſtles pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedings. 
<q>1. Doctrine, <hi>That it is one part of the work of a
gospel-Miniſter to anticipate and anſwer thoſe Objections which they
foreſee may ariſe either through ignorance or obſtinacy againſt their
Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine.</hi>
               </q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="212" facs="tcp:107768:116"/>This our Apoſtle is careful in, and
therefore he repeats the Objection, and prepares to take it off; It is certain,
that the beſt and cleareſt of doctrines may admit of cavils and objections,
and therefore their mouths muſt be ſtopped by the power of reaſon and
current of Scriptures: whether S. <hi>Paul</hi> met with this Objection in ſo
many words, or whether he meets with it in his own apprehenſion he proceeds
upon it; we are not bound to ſtay till an Objection comes out, but we may
antici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pate it: this was much the practice of Jeſus Chriſt and his
forerunner <hi>John, Matt.</hi> 3. <hi>think not to ſay you have Abraham to
your father,</hi> Matth. 5. <hi>think not that I am come to deſtroy the
law;</hi> ſo <hi>chap.</hi> 9. when he ſaw their blaſphemous thoughts
concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing his pronouncing forgiveneſſe of ſin, he an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwers them in
their thoughts, ſo <hi>Luk.</hi> 12. he ſaw that they had ſome ſecret
thoughts that his coming ſhould procure peace, but he teacheth them the
contrary, ſo <hi>Luk.</hi> 4.23. he prepares for their ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection againſt
him, becauſe he did not do thoſe works in his own Countrey that he did
elſewhere; and we have the ſame ſpirit appearing in this E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſtle
alſo, <hi>chap.</hi> 11.19. <hi>thou wilt ſay then, they were broken off,
that I might be graffed in:</hi> the Apoſtle anticipates what they would
ſay before they ſaid it: So 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 15.34. <hi>Some men will ſay,
how are the dead raiſed?</hi> This may ſerve for Inſtruction to
goſpel-Miniſters, conſider well what may be ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jected againſt your
doctrine, and prepare an an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer, leave not any pit of Objection open leſt
any ſhould fall into it: this is greatly the care of our Apoſtle in this
Chapter.</p>
            <q>
               <pb n="213" facs="tcp:107768:116"/>2. Doctrine, <hi>That God may juſtly finde
fault with thoſe whom he judicially hardens.</hi>
            </q>
            <p>It was the ignorance or perverſeneſſe of theſe Objectors,
ſo to think or ſuppoſe, that God might not finde fault with thoſe whom
he hardeneth; for it is certain, God doth and may finde fault, and blame
thoſe whom he hardeneth; he did ſo to the Jews and alſo to
<hi>Pharaoh,</hi> as you may ſee <hi>Ex.</hi> 9.17. <hi>Matt.</hi> 23.</p>
            <p>And that God may juſtly and righteouſly com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plain of thoſe
who are hardened by him, I ſhall offer four Reaſons. 
<list>
                  <item>1. Becauſe God doth not poſitively or forcibly nor yet
primarily or antecedently harden any (as you have heard) but accidentally by
the paſſages of his providence.</item>
                  <item> 2. He hardens none but ſuch as firſt harden
themſelves voluntarily under his mercies, yea ſuch mercies and means as are
as proper, yea much more proper, to ſoften then to harden; hardneſſe
in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flicted by God as a puniſhment of former ſin.</item>
                  <item> 3. God may juſtly finde fault and complain of thoſe
hardned by him, becauſe he hardens none but fore againſt his will, when no
mercies nor Judgements will work upon them: he firſt uſeth all means to
prevent it, as you may ſee 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 36.15. it is when there is no
remedy: ſo <hi>Mat.</hi> 23.37. <hi>how often would I have gathered thee as a
hen gathereth her chickens, and ye would not.</hi>
                  </item>
                  <item> 4. He may well complain and finde fault with thoſe
hardened by him, becauſe they ſo continue, notwithſtanding they are not
neceſſitated, neither are they ſhut up in an incapacity of returning to 
<pb n="214" facs="tcp:107768:117"/>ſoftneſſe, as hath been plainly proved as to
<hi>Pharaoh</hi> and the Jews;</item>
               </list> therefore it is not abſurd for God to finde fault with
thoſe hardned by him.</p>
            <q>3. Doctrine, <hi>That Gods will and purpoſe as to man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kinde, in
order to mercy and judgement, is not i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> reſistible.</hi> This I have alſo ſpoken to in the
Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plication.</q>
            <p>The Fourth and laſt Doctrine is this, 
<q>
                  <hi>That Circumciſed Jews, a people near to God, and a people
that had received kindeneſſe from God, above all others, are moſt
abuſive, perverſe, and rebellious againſt God:</hi>
               </q>
            </p>
            <p>Theſe are the only people who contend and quarrel with God, God
had oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion in all ages to complain of <hi>Iſrael;</hi> ſee that
pathetical complaint, <hi>Eſa.</hi> 1. <hi>I have nouriſhed and brought up
children, and they have rebelled againſt me:</hi> theſe are the people that
God complains of, <hi>Jer.</hi> 2. that ſaid, <hi>they were Lords, and they
would come no more to God:</hi> theſe are they that charge Gods ways with
unequallity, which God complains of, <hi>Ezek.</hi> 18.29. is it not ſuch a
ſpirit that our Apoſtle in their children here fights againſt; a
perverſe, an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gry, quarrelſome ſpirit againſt God did always attend
them: none have been ſo boldly abuſive to God as his own people; theſe
are they that are finding fault and replying againſt God, whilſt they are
demanding why he finds fault with them.</p>
            <p>From hence we may draw a double Uſe of admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration. 
<list>
                  <item>1. At the baſeneſs of mens hearts, that ſhould ſo
evil requite God, who had made them his peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple above all the world beſides;
God hath often <pb n="215" facs="tcp:107768:117"/>had occaſion from his people to appeal
to the nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons upon this account; as to their reſpect and ſtedfaſtneſs
to their gods above his people to himſelf.</item>
                  <item> 2. We have from hence cauſe to admire at the
unconceiveable patience and long-ſuffering of God to mankinde, yea to his
people: oh the pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tience of God to thoſe rebellious Jews whom he had brought
out of <hi>Egypt:</hi> how did he bear with them in all their murmurings and
rebellion in the wilderneſs, for 40. years: he ſuffered their man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners, as
the Pſalmiſt ſpeaks;</item>
               </list> but as to the curſed nature of this Objection, you will
preceive more hereafter, from the Apoſtles anſwer in the four following
verſes. So much for the 19. <hi>vers.</hi>

            <p>AS to the reading of theſe words, I finde very little variation,
therefore I ſhall handle them as they lye before us. Theſe verſes to the
end of the 23. requires our diligent enquiry into and care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full heeding,
becauſe they ſeem to have much darkneſs and knottineſs in them, on the
one hand.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="216" facs="tcp:107768:118"/>And 2ly, on the other hand being rightly
under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood, they will caſt and contribute much light to the precedent
verſes; but it is plain that theſe ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes are by many perſons much
wreſted and abuſed, as they are compelled to ſerve in that hard ſervice
of ſtrengthening that hard-favoured opinion of perſonal and eternal
predeſtination, ſcarce any one paſſage of Scripture more frequently
abuſed then this 20. <hi>v.</hi> it is a weapon near at hand upon all
oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſions to take up to ſilence, thoſe who do but queſtion their
irrational, abſurd and horrid extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vagant notions about Gods eternal
perſonal electi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on or reprobation, they preſently ſnatch up this
Apoſtolical reply, who art thou that replyeſt a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt God? as if he that
aſſerts the doctrine afore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaid were as infallible as the Apoſtle was,
when he ſpake theſe words; nay although the matter a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt which this
reply is taken up, be of another nature then this before us.</p>
            <p>Before I come to the words, it may not be amiſs to give you a
hint of what is commonly built up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on theſe words by the perſons forenamed,
which are theſe and ſuch like notions, that God of his meer pleaſure
antecedent to all ſin original or actu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al, did decree to glorify his
ſoveraignity and juſtice in the eternal rejection and damnation of the far
greater number of mankinde, nay, all but a rem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant; and that this may have a
face of juſtice and e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity with it, he hath ſhut them up under an
una<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voidable neceſſity of ſinning and rebelling againſt himſelf, and
refuſing his grace: that God hath as abſolute power to create, thus
veſſels of honour and diſhonour, and conſequently of wrath, as the
potter hath to make veſſels for inferiour and ſupe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riour 
<pb n="217" facs="tcp:107768:118"/>uſe at his pleaſure, without contradiction, of the
ſame lump of clay.</p>
            <p>And that theſe are the notions declared of many, my own ears are
witneſs, though indeed there are ſome who although they hold the ſame,
yet are a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhamed to make application of their own princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples; and if any
perſon ſhall ſoberly urge the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradictiouſneſs of ſuch notions
to Gods declarati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, and his oath to the contrary, then preſently this is
returned, <hi>who art thou that replieſt againſt God?</hi> and it follows,
<hi>ſhall the thing formed, ſay to him that formed it, why haſt thou made
me thus?</hi> and know this, that theſe abominable God-abuſing notions and
opinions, with ſuch confidence, are built upon a double miſtake of the
Apoſtles Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine in theſe verſes, and ſo they are erroneous in their
foundation: as that,</p>
            <p>1. This forming and making in this context doth refer to mans
creation at firſt in <hi>Adam,</hi> and that the lump which is here intended,
is the maſs of earth tha<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>
               <hi>Adam</hi> was made of, and that God from that original, made or determined
ſome for veſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſels of honour or elect, and the far greater number for
reprobates or veſſels of diſhonour and wrath, not conſidering what the
Scripture ſpeaks to the quite contrary, as to that making, that God made man
<hi>upright,</hi> even all good and veſſels of ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour.</p>
            <p>2. This miſtake is founded either upon an igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant or wilful
miſ-underſtanding, that this abaſing of men according to our text, is the
fruit of diſobe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience and rebellion, and abuſe of Gods mercies,
long-ſuffering, and patience, as this parable in our text doth ſet forth,
as it alludes to <hi>Jer.</hi> 18.6. it is <hi>when the clay is marred in the
hand of the potter,</hi> in <pb n="218" facs="tcp:107768:119"/>not ſubmitting and yielding
to the mould to be a veſſel of honour, then and not till then his minde
changes, and he makes him another veſſel: for al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though it muſt needs be
granted, that it is in the potters power in one ſence to make moſt of his
veſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſels for inferiour and diſhonourable uſe, yet it is not for his
intereſt ſo to do, in caſe the clay will run, ſo as to make a finer
ſort; a workman doth not uſually commit ſuch waſte upon his materials,
much leſs doth the moſt wiſe God, who made man to glorifie his grace: but
I ſhall have occaſion to ſpeak to this in the next verſe; only in a few
words, I ſhall ſhow you, that there was no ſuch doctrine on foot in this
context and controverſy with the Jews, as perſonal and abſolute eternal
election and reprobation, as I have ſhown and proved all a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long by many
arguments: it is a grand miſtake to think that any thing of that kinde had
been proper in this caſe: for if the Jews had underſtood, that perſonal
and abſolute election and reprobation had been S. <hi>Pauls</hi> doctrine, it
had been againſt their judgment and intereſt to have oppoſed him in it or
cavilled againſt it; for they could not but know, that if there were any
perſons above others under perſonal election, it muſt be the
circumci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed Jews who were choſen in <hi>Abraham, Iſaac,</hi> and
<hi>Jacob:</hi> and God had before told them, that he had elected or choſen
them above all the nations of the world beſides, to be <hi>a peculiar people
unto him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf:</hi> they are called <hi>Gods charge</hi> or <hi>lot;</hi>
therefore we muſt conclude, that the Apoſtle was not here treating of that
point, namely, of meer perſonal election or reprobation, but a ſpecifical
election of perſons ſo qualified, namely, believers and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beyers of the
goſpel, whether Jews or gentiles: <pb n="219" facs="tcp:107768:119"/>and this is the
doctrine that offends the Jews, that God had deſtroyed that perſonal
election (as they thought <hi>Paul</hi> preacht) and made both Jews and
gentiles level, that they had no priviledge or ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage more then the
gentiles, as to juſtification, without faith in Jeſus Chriſt: of all
people under heaven none were more for perſonal election then the Jews: ſee
what pains God takes to perſwade <hi>Peter</hi> to be otherwiſe minded
<hi>to go to the gentiles, Act.</hi> 10.10.</p>
            <p>2. That perſonal election or reprobation was not the doctrine
that was on foot in theſe verſes, becauſe ſuch a doctrine would have
been hetero<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geneous, and of another kinde to all the reſt of the context in
general: for it is not hard for the wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keſt who are willing to underſtand,
to ſee that the great controverſy lay about the terms of juſtificati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
whether by the law or faith, which contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſy needs not have been, if
perſonal election had been the deſigne.</p>
            <p>3. It is plain, that the controverſy doth not in theſe
verſes depend about that point, nor the firſt making, but that making which
is Gods handling perſons made: it is not ſaid, that God ordained
<hi>Pharaoh</hi> in creation to be hard, but it was done in time upon his own
hardning firſt, and after he had endured him in his long ſuffering a great
while, as you ſhall hear upon <hi>ver.</hi> 22. 23. making doth not always
refer to proper making in creation, in the Scriptures, but handling as we may
perceive, <hi>Mat.</hi> 23.15. and ſeveral other places: this form<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing or
making <hi>Pharaoh</hi> was Gods juſt hardning him, and ſo as to the Jews,
their objection did not lie, as to their firſt making or creation; they have
nothing to alledge againſt that, but about <pb n="220" facs="tcp:107768:120"/>their
preſent making or forming by God to deſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, for their rebellion
againſt Chriſt and the goſpel: the Jews above all other people were
ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nourable veſſels in their firſt making of this kinde, in Gods handling
them: but for their ſins they were propheſyed of <hi>to be
diſhonourable,</hi> Hoſ. 8.8. <hi>now ſhall ye be amongſt the gentiles
as a veſſel in whom is no pleaſure:</hi> but I proceed to the words
themſelves diſtinctly, wherein we have the Apoſtles zealous and
pathetical anſwer to the Jews captious and quarrelſome objection,
<hi>ver.</hi> 19. this anſwer of the Apoſtle conſiſts of two parts. 
<list>
                  <item>1. We have a ſharp and ſevere reproof in the former
part of the words.</item>
                  <item>2. We have a ſubſtantial confutation even to
conviction, to the end of the 23. <hi>verſ.</hi>
                  </item>
               </list> by the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles anſwer to this objection we may
clearly ſee the nature of it, that it did tend to the diſparage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment and
impeachment of the wiſdome and power of God, in his handling and hardning
whom he will: the objecter will not allow the almighty that liberty which he
will allow a mean tradeſman, a potter, to deſigne and form his veſſel
either more honourably or more contemptibly at his pleaſure, and according as
his ſtuff will run, either finer or courſer: the Objecter will not allow
God to make of a ſtubborn rebellious perſon or people, a veſſel or
veſſels of diſhonour, and to make thoſe who o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bey the goſpel, and
ſo yeild and ſubmit in his hands, veſſels of honour, namely, ſuch as
are cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led both Jews and gentiles, before prepared unto glory.</p>
            <p>I ſhall firſt ſpeak unto the reproof contained in theſe
words, wherein we have theſe four circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances conſiderable. 
<list>
                  <item>
                     <pb n="221" facs="tcp:107768:120"/>1. We have the Apoſtle deſigning
to abaſe the objecter by the manner of his ſpeaking, <hi>(but O man who art
thou?)</hi> which is compellation of dimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nution; what a man, a poor mortal
man, ſold un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der ſin, lyable to death at Gods pleaſure, what thou to
ſtir up thy ſelf againſt thy creator! this kinde of ſpeaking tends to
lay men low, as when <hi>David</hi> thus ſpeaks, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 8. <hi>what
is man that thou art mindful of him?</hi> the tendency of his words are to
abaſe men.</item>
                  <item> 2. In this reproof we have the Apoſtle laying before
them the tranſendant power, wiſdom, might, majeſty of him againſt whom
they conten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, couched in this appellation <hi>(God), who art thou that
replyeſt againſt God?</hi>
                  </item>
                  <item> 3. The Apoſtle lays before them the nature and quallity
of their ſin by name; he calls it, replying, taking up a diſpute or
anſwering again, the which is forbidden to ſervants, as to poor mortal men,
<hi>Tit.</hi> 2.9. <hi>not anſwering again or gainſaying.</hi>
                  </item>
                  <item> 4. We have the Apoſtle amplifying and enlarg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing upon
the indignity and unworthyneſſe of the objecter, by a ſimilitude of the
work and work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man; <hi>ſhall the thing formed ſay to him that formed it why
haſt thou made me thus?</hi>
                  </item>
               </list>this compariſon ſets out the deportment of the objector
towards God, with a kinde of unnatural prodigious deformity and
unworthyneſſe; for what can be more repug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant to nature, then for that
thing or perſon which receives his being from another, to quarrel with him
about the nature of that his being the ſheep, that he is not an oxe, the oxe
that he is not a man, men that they are not angels; or according to the
Metaphor, as if the chamberpot ſhould ſay to the potter; why was not I a
drinking-pot? ſo that we <pb n="222" facs="tcp:107768:121"/>may perceive by the manner of
the Apoſtles ſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and arguing, that his deſigne was to abaſe and
lay low the objector, even thoſe Jews who had been charging God with either
defect in wiſdom or in power, this vocative kinde of ſpeaking is the effect
of paſſion of minde, <hi>O man!</hi> ſometimes won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, ſometimes of
ſorrow mixt with love; ſee 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 18.33. <hi>O my ſon Abſalom,
O Abſalom my ſon, my ſon!</hi> ſignifying very high paſſion of
minde: ſo <hi>Mat.</hi> 23.37. <hi>O Jeruſalem!</hi> ſorrow mixed with
love and pitty, the Apoſtle is under much paſſion of minde, for theſe
his contrey-men according to the fleſh; as he alſo ſeems to be in the
beginning of this chapter; he had a great zeal for this people, and it grieves
him to ſee them ſo obſtinate againſt their own mercy in this
paſſion of minde, he ſeems to ſpeak to the ſame people,
<hi>chap.</hi> 2.1. <hi>O man!</hi> ver. 3. <hi>O man!</hi> the Apoſtle in
our Text is not only thus affected for their ſin but the diſhonour of God;
and now his deſigne is to vindicate the honour of God; but ſome may ſay,
what was there more particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly in this objection that ſo much provoked the
Apoſtle to make this pathetical reply in order to abaſing the objector? I
anſwer there appears four circumſtances in it, that doth ſo greatly
ſtir up the Apoſtles zeal. 
<list>
                  <item>1. The Apoſtle had a clear ſight from what ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit
this objection did ariſe, which was not from ignorance or weakneſſe, but
from an arrogant, captious, quarrelſome ſpirit, a bold, imperious,
inſulting ſpirit againſt God.</item>
                  <item> 2. The Apoſtle in this objection perceives much
ſlighting and undervaluing put upon God himſelf; from the very manner of
ſpeaking: we have not ſo much as one of theſe honourable names or titles 
<pb n="223" facs="tcp:107768:121"/>of God inſerted, neither <hi>God</hi> nor
<hi>Lord,</hi> but <hi>he</hi> and <hi>his;</hi> which we always account
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap> ſlight put up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on any
ſuperiours by inferiours: as <hi>ſhe</hi> or <hi>he</hi> ſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of
parents or maſters.</item>
                  <item> 3. We have in this objection or reply
ſelf-juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication: <hi>why doth he yet finde fault?</hi> they ſee no
cauſe of Gods finding fault with all their behavi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our under his judicial
hardning, they are blamed, but they know not for what; they ſee no
cauſe.</item>
                  <item> 4. We have at leaſt implicitly a charging all their
diſobedience, and rebellion, and hardneſſe of heart upon God, as the
fruit of his irreſiſtable determination and decree, as we may ſee in the
reading the words, <hi>who hath reſiſted his will?</hi> where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as it hath
been proved, that the worſt of ſinners; ſuch hardened by God, are not
neceſſitated by God ſo to remain:</item>
               </list>but there are two things to be enqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red into by way of
explication, the anſwer to which may be of great uſe to clear the Text and
context. 
<list>
                  <item>1. What is, or where is it ſinful to diſcourſe,
reaſon or word it with Ged?</item>
                  <item> 2ly, What making or form are the Jews put into by God, at
which they are ſo much offended, and at which they thus quarrel with
God?</item>
               </list> of both theſe I ſhall particularly ſpeak a few
words.</p>
            <p n="1">1. We are not to underſtand by all that the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle
hath ſo importunately ſpoken, as if it were un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lawful or unmeet for men
with reverence to God &amp; ſobriety, to ſearch out the
righteouſneſſe, wiſdom, and goodneſſe of the ways and counſels of
God: we ſhall finde that this hath been allowed and accept<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed from men.
Queſtions of this kinde have receiv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed anſwer, as is plain in
<hi>Abrahams</hi> caſe, <hi>Gen.</hi> 18, how freely did <hi>Abraham</hi>
reaſon and diſcourſe <pb n="224" facs="tcp:107768:122"/>with God about the
deſtruction of <hi>Sodom,</hi> and God was not angry with him, but
condeſcends to his propoſitions: ſuch familliarity did <hi>Job</hi> take
upon him, <hi>Job</hi> 21. and ſo did <hi>Jeremiah, chap.</hi> 12. <hi>let me
talk with thee of thy judgments:</hi> God is willing his ways and works
ſhould be enquired into, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided it be with a humble ſpirit and with due
re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect to the Majeſty and power of God; that is, not replying againſt
God, which many times is ſo accounted from this place, to ſtand up for the
vin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dication of Gods equitable and impartial proceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing with mankinde, when by
the doctrines and principles of ſome they muſt neceſſarily be
im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peached; for to ſhew the abſurdity of ſuch opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons is not taxable by
our Apoſtle in this text; thoſe who are of that opinion to urge this text,
to op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe ſuch vindication of Gods righteouſneſs, ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſeth the
Jews to be of that which they call the Arminian principle, which is a great
miſtake in them: for there were no people under heaven more cordially
principled on the other hand for a meer perſonal election then they; they
took all but themſelves to be reprobates, and forbid, <hi>that the goſpel
ſhould be preached to them that they might be ſaved:</hi> 1
<hi>Theſ.</hi> 2.16. this S. <hi>Paul</hi> complains of, that by the Jews he
was forbidden to diſcharge his of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice in this kinde, therefore they were far
enough from the opinion of univerſal and impartial grace: but this I ſhall
ſpeak unto more afterwards as I proceed; but to ſpeak poſitively to this
queſtion, I anſwer, to reply or take up a diſpute againſt God according
to this text, is conſidered two ways. 
<list>
                  <item>1. In matter.</item>
                  <item> 2. In form.</item>
               </list>
            </p>
            <p>As to the manner or form, when our words are <pb n="225" facs="tcp:107768:122"/>ſtout and bold, without rendring God his due Ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tles; ſee what a
humble frame of ſpirit <hi>Abraham</hi> appeared in, in his reaſoning with
God; and ſo likewiſe <hi>Ieremiah, Iob,</hi> and others alſo, the
con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary whereunto God complains of, <hi>Mal.</hi> 3.13. God complains that
their words were ſtout, ſo in this text, their words were of a gainſaying
nature, the Jews ſpake to God as if he were their equall. this was the manner
of <hi>Pharaohs</hi> ſpeaking, <hi>Exo.</hi> 5. <hi>who is the Lord? I know
him not:</hi> and this was the ſpirit of the Jews in the wilderneſs, they
mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mured and quarrelled againſt God, thus much as to the manner.</p>
            <p>2. As to the matter condemnable, when what is ſpoken or thought
doth tend in it ſelf to the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paraging the Wiſdom of God: this is an
exceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing high peece of preſumption againſt the moſt high and moſt
wiſe God; this God will not bear with in his moſt dear ſervant
<hi>Job:</hi> in all his ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſite miſery he muſt not be allowed to
ſpeak the leaſt word that might reflect upon the wiſdom of God; ſee how
ſeverely God ſpeaks to him, <hi>Chap.</hi> 40.2. <hi>Shall he that
contendeth with the all<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty inſtruct him? he that reproveth God let him
anſwer it;</hi> and <hi>Job</hi> falls flat under it, elſe he had been
broken: ſee the ſharp rebuke of God to ſuch a people as this,
<hi>Eſa.</hi> 45.9. <hi>Wo to him that ſtriveth with his maker, ſhall the
clay ſay to the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhioner, what makeſt thou? or thy work, he hath no
hands?</hi> It is imperfect blaming the work of God; this is the ſpirit
diſcovered in the Text, God will not have his Wiſdome nor his Power
queſtio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="226" facs="tcp:107768:123"/>2. It is ſin when men do not quietly ſit
down under the mighty hand of God, <hi>who art thou that replyeſt againſt
God?</hi> that doth not ſit down ſilent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly under Gods reproofs, but
complains diſcon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentedly, like <hi>Jonas</hi> to be angry, and vindicate
himſelf in ſo doing: but that which is altogether needfull to be enquired
into, is the matter againſt which the Jews finde themſelves ſo aggreived
and diſcontented, and wherein they do implicitly im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peach the wisdom and
power of God: and that is ſuppoſed here by our Apoſtle to be about their
form or ſhape, which they were now made in, therefore the Apoſtle ſets it
forth by a ſimilitude of a <hi>workman</hi> and <hi>his work;</hi> as the
work diſparaging the workman, ſaying to him in a diſparaging way, <hi>why
haſt thou made me thus?</hi> or of this faſhion or ſhape: this our
Apoſtle judgeth a parallel inſtance to the caſe. Now the queſtion then
is, what form of ſhape are the Jews caſt into with which they are ſo
diſpleaſed? to this I ſhall ſpeak in anſwer, both negatively and
affirmatively: but before I ſpeak particularly to it, I premiſe this by the
way, that this word <hi>make</hi> or <hi>form</hi> in Scripture hath divers
acceptations, a matter of twelve ways it is taken: ſo that it is not always
to be under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood to reſpect creation of man, but ſometimes to ordain and
conſtitute; thus God is ſaid to make <hi>Saul</hi> king, that is, put him
into ſuch a capacity: thus it muſt be underſtood, <hi>Eſa.</hi>
43.7.21. <hi>this peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple have I formed for my ſelf,</hi> that is, with
reſpect of their reſtoration: thus <hi>Paul</hi> ſpeaks 1 <hi>Cor.</hi>
4.13. ſo <hi>Rev.</hi> 5.10. <hi>he hath made us kings and
prieſts.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">Now what making did the Jews quarrel at? 
<list>
                  <item>1. Negatively, the Jews could not here mean by
<hi>making</hi> and <hi>forming,</hi> their original creation in 
<pb n="227" facs="tcp:107768:123"/>
                     <hi>Adam,</hi> their forming there and then was as good
as all the reſt; there was nothing on foot of this nature in all the
controverſie (as I have ſhewn be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore;) they could not be offended at their
proper term.</item>
                  <item> 2. Neither could it be ſuppoſed, that they in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended
Gods decree or ordination of Reprobation, for they were far enough from
believing that no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion as to themſelves eſpecially; neither is there any
thing in the Context that ſounds that way as to perſonal election:</item>
               </list>but of this I ſhall ſpeak more clearly when I come to
<hi>ver.</hi> 21.</p>
            <p>But affirmatively, there was a twofold <hi>framing</hi> or
<hi>making</hi> upon the Jews, at which they were much offended at God, and
both reſpecting Gods pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent dealings with them for their actual rebellion
againſt the Goſpel, which was now judicially up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on them. 
<list>
                  <item>1. They were by God ſubjugated in their out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward ſtate
to the Nations, as to their outward glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry and politick government, wherein
they had ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded all the world beſides; <hi>Gods preſence was in the
midſt of them; his ſanctuary was amongſt them; they were his firſt-born
ſon,</hi> the head and not the tail; this people are now <hi>ſcattered
amongst the Nations, and their temple and glory laid in the duſt,</hi> they
are made <hi>as a veſſel in whom is no pleaſure;</hi> as it was
propheſied of them, <hi>Hoſ.</hi> 8.8. and herein are a diſhonourable
veſſel according to our Text: this our Lord tells them <hi>Matth.</hi> 23.
<hi>laſt. their houſe is left deſolate:</hi> this formation they are
greatly offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded at, <hi>why haſt thou made me thus?</hi> ſay they, they
are not ſenſible of any ſin of theirs that could de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve this forming,
nay, they queſtioned whether God had power or right to thus make them,
con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary <pb n="228" facs="tcp:107768:124"/>to his promiſe made to their fathers
<hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham, Iſaac</hi> and <hi>Jacob.</hi>
                  </item>
                  <item> 2. They took themſelves wronged (as we may perceive)
that God had put them out of a capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>city of obtaining juſtification or
ſalvation, by all their zeal and legal obedience, whilſt enemies &amp;
rejecters of Jeſus Chriſt; they are threatned with eternal death <hi>if
they do not believe in Jeſus Chriſt; ye ſhall die in your ſins,</hi>
notwithſtanding all your legal obedience, if you believe not that I am he:
<hi>why haſt thou made me thus?</hi> that is, put me into this
capacity:</item>
               </list>Now the great deſigne of the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle is ſtill to
maintain Gods unqueſtionable right of power, to turn a diſobedient people
into what form he pleaſe, when they have firſt abas't them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves by
rebellion; he ſtill carries on the ſame con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluſion, <hi>be hardens whom
he will:</hi> but according to promiſe I ſhall be brief upon this verſe,
becauſe I ſhall meet with it more fully and properly in the following
verſe that which remains according to our uſual proceedings, in order to
concluding this <hi>verſe,</hi> is only to lay down thoſe Doctrinal
con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluſions that offers themſelves to us from theſe words.</p>
            <p>1. From the Apoſtles zealous replication, I note. 
<q>1. Doctrine, <hi>That it is the nature of a true cordial
faithful ſervant of God to have his zeal kindled, when he hears Gods name and
glory diſhonoured, and his attributes, his wiſdom, power, mercy, and
goodneſs abuſed.</hi>
               </q>
            </p>
            <p>This was the ſpirit of meek <hi>Moſes Exo.</hi> 32.19. he
brake the tables hereupon: this was the ſpirit of <hi>Jobs</hi> friends, when
they ſaw but the leaſt ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance <pb n="229" facs="tcp:107768:124"/>hereof, as they
thought in <hi>Job.</hi> So it was with <hi>Paul</hi> at the ſight of
Idolatry <hi>Act.</hi> 16. <hi>his ſpirit was ſtirred in him:</hi> it is as
it is with a dutyful childe to his father, he cannot bear to ſee him
diſhonour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed; ſo <hi>David</hi> was ſenſible hereof, <hi>Pſal.</hi>
42.10. as a ſword in his bones: <hi>Paul</hi> and <hi>Barnabas waxed bold,
Act.</hi> 13.46. <hi>when the Jews blaſphemed:</hi> ſee alſo
<hi>Pſal.</hi> 44. ſo was <hi>Hezekiah,</hi> upon the blaſphe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my of
<hi>Rabſhakeh,</hi> 2 <hi>Kings</hi> 19. compared with <hi>Eſa.</hi>
37.</p>
            <p>From the deſigne of the Apoſtle to abaſe the Jews. 
<q>2. Doctrine, <hi>The great ſin of the circumciſed Jews was
ſpiritual pride, or pride of ſpirit.</hi>
               </q>
            </p>
            <p>This ſin of pride in them God complains of old, <hi>Hoſe.</hi>
5.5. <hi>cha.</hi> 7.10. their pride was teſtified to their face; and to this
our Apoſtle ſpeaks, <hi>Rom.</hi> 2. they made their boaſt, <hi>they
ſaid we ſee, John</hi> 9.</p>
            <q>3. Doctrine, <hi>It is a very high piece of preſumption and
impudence in man to queſtion the reaſonableneſs of the terms and
conditions propounded by God in order to mans juſtification and
ſalvation.</hi>
            </q>
            <p>To ſay or think that there is a defect in Gods wiſdom in
propounding ſuch or ſuch a way rather then ſuch; this was the very caſe
in hand, and the great fault of the Jews; this is very unreaſonable ſo to
reply: it is but reaſonable and equal, that he that is ſole author and
donor of mans ſalvation, ſhould take his own way, and propound his own
terms upon which perſons ſhall reap that benefit: if God be about to
bleſs <hi>Abraham</hi> with a great <pb n="230" facs="tcp:107768:125"/>bleſſing, to
make him the father of the faithful, he muſt follow God at his foot, ſtoop
to his directi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons in every thing, as to the way to it; the clay muſt yield
to the hand of the potter, if it will be a veſſel of honour: to this
ſpeaks <hi>Eſaiah</hi> 40.13. <hi>cha.</hi> 45.11. they muſt not command
God.</p>
            <q>4. Doctrine, <hi>It is very unreaſonable and a high provoking
ſin againſt God, for a poor finite crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, who hath received his very
being from him, and who hath forfeited his very being a thouſand times by
ſin, yet to be found diſputing and quarrel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling'with God about the form of
his being, why he is not treated better by his maker.</hi>
            </q>
            <p>As if a malefactor pardoned by the king ſhould quarrel with him,
that he did not make him one of his bed chamber or confer ſome great honour
upon him; may not God do what he will with his own? <hi>Mat.</hi> 20.7,8.</p>
            <q>5. Doctrine, <hi>That the great diſpute that the unbe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieving
Jews had with God, was not about their o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riginal making, or future rewarding,
but about their preſent handling, called making.</hi>
            </q>
            <p>The Jews queſtion with God about the juſtneſs of his
preſent judicial diſpenſations upon them, <hi>why haſt thou made me
thus?</hi> the truth of this will more clearly appear if we conſult the
context a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout this preſent hardning whom he will.</p>
            <p>But I proceed to the next verſe.</p>

               </p>
               <p>I need not (I ſuppoſe) tell you, that this paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſage, and
the words before us, in the 21. verſe, is the chief of that preſumed
ſtrength, which many think they have in this chapter, to ſtand by them in
their opinion of an abſolute perſonal election and reprobation, upon a meer
perſonal account or conſideration: but upon due conſideration and
ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amination, it will appear to be one of the moſt ſerviceable paſſages
in this chapter to the contrary opinion, and to demonſtrate, that there is
nothing of ſuch a nature in this context, as perſonall e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lection or
reprobation before-time, or without condition.</p>
               <p>I finde three opinions upon theſe words.</p>
               <p n="1">1. Some are of opinion, that the words here are to be
taken to relate directly and properly to God, and admits of no compariſon;
<hi>hath not the potter,</hi> that is, <hi>hath not God power to make one
veſſel to ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour &amp; another to diſhonor?</hi> (that is of a right
pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er) over that earth, of which he intended to make man, that of the ſame
piece of it he may lawfully make ſome for life, and ſome for death and
de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction.</p>
               <p>But the words doth not afford them any ſuch no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, if indeed
it had run thus; <hi>hath not our</hi> or <hi>the heavenly potter power?</hi>
but this word <hi>potter</hi> without any article of application to God, will
not afford ſuch an interpretation, nor authorize ſuch a
con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction.</p>
               <p n="2">2. There are others that do grant, that theſe words are
comparatively ſpoken in each word as <hi>potter, power,</hi> clay,
<hi>veſſel;</hi> of this minde is <hi>Calvin</hi> and <hi>Beza:</hi> but
that the application is not made by <pb n="233" facs="tcp:107768:126"/>the Apoſtle, but is
left to be ſuppoſed by the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der; which if ſo, then the application
muſt be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to each mans judgment upon it: ſome therefore proceeds
thus, as granting a compariſon, <hi>hath not an ordinary potter power over
the ſame clay or lump to make according to his own pleaſure, one
veſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſel to honour and another to diſhonour?</hi> even ſo and much more
hath God power at his pleaſure, of the earth to make one man to life, and
another to condemnation. This is the ſupplyed application which ſome
(ſuppoſing the ſpirit of God hath left none) preſume to give out from
the treaſuries of their own underſtandings, to ſupply the defects of the
ſpirit, where nothing is wanting, nor no need of their help: yet thoſe whom
I have read that are of this opinion, (I do faithfully aſſure you) are much
divided amongſt themſelves about this clay and lump: ſome think it is men
uncreate or before creation; others think, that it is man create before his
fall; others think, it is after his fall; great di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſion is amongſt them
about this matter, which doth much incline us to queſtion, whether the truth
in this matter is amongſt them.</p>
               <p>And the truth of this matter is near to each of us, if we will
receive it; for according to the context and parallel place, <hi>Jer.</hi> 18.
the clay and lump here intended, is <hi>man,</hi> conſidered as he hath
voluntari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly abas't himſelf by a courſe of obſtinate ſinning a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt
God: but the aforeſaid extravagant opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions are occaſioned from a
miſtaken ground, think<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that the ſpirit of God had not explained this
parable of the potter.</p>
               <p>But ſuppoſe there were no application of this inſtance by
the ſpirit of God, but it be left to men, the queſtion is whether a fairer
and better might <pb n="234" facs="tcp:107768:127"/>not be made, then what commonly is made?
ſure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly yea: it is granted on all hands, <hi>that the potter hath power over
the clay, of the ſame lump, to make one veſſel to honour and another to
diſhonour:</hi> why not this application as well as that? in like man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner,
and much more, hath God power, (which none can be offended at,) over men who
have cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupted and abaſed themſelves by a voluntary courſe of ſinning
and diſobedience (whereby he may be accounted as a lump of clay,) to ordain
ſome of them, namely, believers, to veſſels of ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour, and others of the
ſame lump who reject his grace and love, veſſels of diſhonour and
wrath: Is not this interpretation as proper as the former?</p>
               <p n="3">But there is a third opinion, which grant, the words are a
compariſon, and alſo, that we have the application made to our hands; and
that the ſpirit is not beholding to any man to lend him his help herein, but
that this application is ready made, and contained in <hi>ver.</hi> 22. 23. and
this third opinion I finde neareſt to the truth; and I queſtion not, but
ſo will you alſo, as we go along: it is eaſily granted, that every
compariſon contains two parts, the fore-part of it, and the application of
it; and the ſame you ſhall finde here. I ſcarce meet with any
expoſitors or interpreters of what judgement ſoever, as well thoſe who
are for perſonal and abſolute election, as others, who do ſo much as put
it to the queſtion, whether our Apoſtle in theſe words before us, had an
eye, at leaſt of alluſion, if not proof and demonſtration, to that place,
<hi>Jer.</hi> 18.3,4,5,6,7. the margent of your bibles gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally have it
quoted; which if it be but granted, that our Apoſtle did at all refer unto
this 18. of <hi>Jer.</hi> then we ſhall eaſily ſee and perceive, that
this <pb n="235" facs="tcp:107768:127"/>21. <hi>verſe</hi> affords no aſſiſtance to
that opinion that is commonly built upon it; nay, the opinion it ſelf by that
means will appear importune and unreaſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable: what ground can be gathered
for the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer interpretation? if <hi>Jer.</hi> 18. be a parrallel place with
this: how then can God be underſtood the alone potter, the earth of which
<hi>Adam</hi> was made the clay and lump, ſeeing in <hi>Ier.</hi> 18. we
finde a pot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter properly ſo underſtood a tradeſman, to whoſe work
<hi>Ieremiah</hi> is ſent, in <hi>Ier.</hi> 18. <hi>Iſrael</hi> in their
de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>generated ſtate is this clay and lump, as in a courſe of ſin and
rebellion; his diſhonourable ſtate is his ſtate of captivity,
<hi>Ier.</hi> 22.28. <hi>Hoſ.</hi> 8.8. but beſides the general received
opinion of men of all judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, I ſhall lay before you ſeven

circumciſed <hi>Iſrael</hi> of God; the Apoſtle <hi>Paul</hi> ſpeaks to
the ſame people, that the prophet <hi>Iere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miah</hi> ſpeaks unto, this I

                     <item> 2. Theſe words were ſpoken to them at both times,

                     <item> 3. Notwithſtanding all their wickedneſſe againſt
God in morals, as to judgement and righteouſneſs, and obedience to Gods
requirements, yet they leaned upon God, and preſumed themſelves to be Gods
only people, and were of opinion, that God could not righteouſly leave them:
ſee what pains God takes to beat them off from this their falſe confidence,
<hi>Ier.</hi> 7. they leaned upon their temple-worſhip, whereupon God

                     <item> 4. The deſigne of both places <hi>ver.</hi> 21. and

                     <item> 5. God in and by <hi>Ieremiah</hi> is not looking back

Apoſtle.</item>
                     <item> 6. The perſons in <hi>Ier.</hi> 18. threatened and
made veſſels of diſhonour, are the very ſame who were on the wheel
deſigned for veſſels of honour, but marred in Gods hand, which clearly
agreeth with 2 <hi>Timo.</hi> 2.20. if a man purge himſelf from this, <hi>he
ſhall be a veſſel of honour:</hi> a great part of <hi>Iſraels</hi>
diſhonour and abaſement lay firſt and laſt in their temporal captivity
and outward deſtruction and deſolation, <hi>Ier.</hi> 18. plucking up, and
deſtroying, laying waſt, <hi>Ier.</hi> 1.10. as alſo deſtruction as to
their place of worſhip, <hi>Ier.</hi> 7.14. <hi>I will do to this houſe

                  </list> thus we ſee, that the Apoſtle <hi>Paul</hi> might
well in this preſent controverſy with theſe latter Jews, allude to that
paſſage, <hi>Ier.</hi> 18. as a place that might comport with his preſent
buſineſſe but I ſhall take a little more particular notice of theſe

ſet forth the curious workmanſhip of God <pb n="238" facs="tcp:107768:129"/>upon man: he
is not red lump, but wrought into clay, that may be moulded, ſhaped and

an <hi>honourable veſſel,</hi> they had been up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the wheel curiouſly
wrought; God had taken them cloſe to himſelf from the common earth and
clay, and prepared them as the potter doth his clay, with much labour, before
it comes to the wheel: God as to his choice love and reſpect to them ſaith,
he hath made them to cleave to and claſp about him as a man doth a girdle,
deſigning them to be for a name, a praiſe and a glory, but they would not:
it is a remarkable paſſage of Gods care, love and reſpect to this people,
<hi>Jerem.</hi> 13.11. as is alſo by Chriſt expreſt as to this peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple,
<hi>Matth.</hi> 23. <hi>how often would I have gathered you and you would
not:</hi> It is a remarkable conſiderati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, that <hi>Ieremiah</hi> muſt
learn and know, that <hi>Iſrael</hi> was not rejected by God in the lump but
upon the wheel, whilſt he was forming them for honour; and this is as true
concerning the Jews with whom the Apoſtle had to do at preſent in our Text:
they alſo were rejected upon the wheel, not in the lump originally
conſidered: this well weighed by the judicial reader may ſatisfy him, that
there is nothing in this verſe to the end it is brought for, as to eternal
perſonal election or reprobation: the inſtance doth not afford the leaſt
whiſper that way, and it is to be admired that any ſhould bring it for that
end.</item>
                     <item> The ſecond leſſon which God would have
<hi>Iere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miah</hi> to learn in the <hi>potters houſe</hi> was, that
<hi>Iſraels</hi> marring and miſcarrying, was from themſelves, as God
tells them elſewhere, <hi>O Iſrael thy deſtructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on is of thy ſelf, not
of me:</hi> It is not probable, that the potter will beſtow the tempering and
fitting the clay, and then work it upon the wheel on purpoſe to break and
ſpoil it: what potter on earth being <pb n="240" facs="tcp:107768:130"/>in his wits
uſeth to do ſo? neither muſt this mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring be imputed to
unskilfulneſſe of the potter, nor any efficient cauſe without them no,
the Text doth undeniably import, that the clay it ſelf only was in the
fault<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and that <hi>Iſraels</hi> deſtruction is of themſelves, is
convincingly preſented in the para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble of the girdle, <hi>chap.</hi> 13. when
<hi>Ieremiah</hi> is dire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted to take a <hi>linnen girdle,</hi> not an
ordinary, not a leathern, but one of the better or higher ſort of girdles,
<hi>a linnen girdle,</hi> a laſting girdle, and whereas <hi>Ieremiah</hi> is
forbid to wet it or hide it in a moiſt place, but in a dry place, in a Rock;
<hi>Iere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miah</hi> is taught that <hi>Iſraels</hi> deſtruction proceeded
from themſelves, and from no extrinſick cauſe: no moiſture, yet the
girdle is marred and good for nothing: ſo here God would well convince
<hi>Iere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miah,</hi> that <hi>Iſraels</hi> deſtruction did not ariſe from
any external or violent means, but it was whilſt on the wheel, in the hand of
the potter, in order to her exaltation: <hi>Ieremiah</hi> is brought to the
<hi>pot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters houſe,</hi> to be taught that their deſtruction is from
themſelves. And as the Apoſtle in another caſe ſaith, <hi>he that
imputes the preſent ſin and eternal deſtruction of men to God, let him be
accurſed; for God would have all men ſaved, and no man
periſh.</hi>
                     </item>
                     <item> 3. God would have <hi>Ieremiah</hi> learn in the
<hi>potters houſe,</hi> as to <hi>Iſrael,</hi> that their becoming a
diſho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nourable veſſel was not the antecedent deſigne of God, but the
ſubſequent deſigne of God: the pot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter at firſt deſigned it an
honourable veſſel, but it is upon its marring that he proceeds to make it
<hi>ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,</hi> as ſeemed good to him to make it: it was then become
obnoxious to the ſubſequent will of God, which then, and not till then,
deſignes it a diſhonourable veſſel: which is undeniably plain, 
<pb n="241" facs="tcp:107768:130"/>if we reade verſe the 9.10. <hi>at what inſtant I
ſpeak concerning a nation to build and plant, if that nation do evil in my
ſight, I will repent of the good that I ſaid I would benefit them:</hi>
Gods antecedent will was to plant and builde, his ſubſequent minde to pluck
up and deſtroy.</item>
                     <item> The 4<hi>th</hi> Leſſon that the Lord would have
<hi>Jere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miah</hi> to learn in the <hi>potters workhouſe,</hi> was, that God
hath ſole and abſolute power over his peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, even ſo, and much more
then the potter o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver the clay, to diſpoſe it at his pleaſure; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
(ſaith he) behold, or take notice, that <hi>as the clay is in the hand of the
potter,</hi> or power of the potter, <hi>ſo are ye in my hand, ſaith the
Lord:</hi> Gods propriety is clearer and more abſolule then a pot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters power
can be: for the potter, and his clay, and all are Gods; the potter hath power
from his propriety and intereſt; he may do what he will with his own but
ſtill for his own advantage, much more may God; if the potters clay will not
ſerve him for one end, it muſt for another: if his clay will not yeild and
comply for an honorable veſſel, can it complain, though he diſpoſe of
it to be a diſhonourable veſſel? ſo if <hi>Iſrael</hi> will not
comply with Gods deſigne, and ſerve him in their own land, they muſt
ſubmit to ſerve his end in their e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemies land as a diſhonourable
veſſel.</item>
                     <item> 5. God would have <hi>Jeremiah</hi> learn in the potters
houſe this leſſon, that the liberty that God claims to himſelf in
making diſhonourable veſſels, is ſuch a power as the potters is, onely
over thoſe who by voluntary diſobedience and rebellion re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſe his offers
of grace and honour: God claims no liberty over that nation or perſon that
repents under the threatnings againſt it, as is eminent <hi>ver.</hi> 8. 
<pb n="242" facs="tcp:107768:131"/>
                        <hi>Jer.</hi> 18. to make them veſſels of
diſhonour: ſo that from what hath been ſpoken upon <hi>Jer.</hi> 18. we
may perceive that it wil be very uſeful in handling this 21. verſe, to
carry our eye upon this ſo par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ralell a place, which will be greatly helpful
in or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der to a right underſtanding: and I will in the fear of God appeal to
the readers conſcience, whether by what God hath ſpoken to
<hi>Jeremiah</hi> you can gather ſuch an opinion, that God hath either
be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, or in the creation, of his meer pleaſure and will, ordained or made
of the earth, veſſels of wrath, upon a meer perſonal account; the whole
neither ſavours of, nor ſavours ſuch an opinion in the leaſt, the power
which this heavenly potter claimeth, is, that when perſons have imbaſed
themſelves by a courſe of actual ſinning and rebel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lion againſt his
grace and mercy, then to turn his hand and make them diſhonourable
veſſels.</item>

fitly reſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled to a potter, who works in that material of <hi>earth</hi>

power over the clay, to make it what veſſel he pleaſe? and when a piece

it is to be underſtood of an uncontroulable prerogative in God by this

of arguing of the Apoſtles: doth it not ſeem ſtrange, that the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtle
doth take ſo much pains to aſſert the power and prerogative of God? are
there any in the world who own God that queſtion this truth? the Apoſtle
ſeems to inſinuate, that the hardening and rejecting of the Jews, was
founded in the abſolute uncon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troulable will of God, rather then upon their
own wickedneſs: <hi>he hardens whom he will: the thing for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med muſt not

may be the reaſon why the Apoſtle argues this way rather then that? are
there any that deny this power of God? I anſwer that the Apoſtle knew what
he did and ſaid of this kinde, though the Jews did not deny the power of God
in one kinde, yet they did queſtion and alſo deny the equitable proceedings
of God, as we may ſee, <hi>Ezek.</hi> 33. <hi>they were bold to ſay the
ways of the Lord were not equal in his dealings towards them:</hi> and further
they queſtioned his wiſdome and truth, in his ſevere dealings with them,
who were the children of the promiſe to <hi>Abraham,</hi> and who walked in
the law of God appointed by him to their fathers: they did queſtion, yea
deny, that God could juſtly eaſt them off upon any terms, or diſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herit 
<pb n="245" facs="tcp:107768:132"/>them, let their manners be what they would, though
greatly degenerated &amp; corrupted by mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral evils, yet as long as they held
to temple-wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip they could not be made diſhonourable: there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it is
no wonder though the Apoſtle argues with them after this manner, it is
undeniably plain, that the Jews would not allow God the power of the potter, to
make a diſhonourable veſſel of marred clay; they lookt upon themſelves
to be the chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren of <hi>Abraham</hi> in the beſt ſence, whilſt they
were children of the devil in the worſt ſence, <hi>Iohn</hi> 8.39,40,44.
ſo their fathers were of the ſame ſpirit, <hi>Ier.</hi> 5.12. they did
conclude <hi>no evil ſhould befal them,</hi> nay their prophets told them
ſo: ſee 23 <hi>chap.</hi> 17. <hi>though they walked in the imaginations of
their own hearts:</hi> ſuch a ſpirit appeared from them, <hi>Ier.</hi> 7.
though they did ſteal, committed adultery, ſwear falſely, yet they
thought God had no right of power to puniſh them, ſo long as they cried
<hi>the temple of the Lord:</hi> and reade but <hi>Rom.</hi> 2. from
<hi>vers.</hi> 17. to the 23. and you ſhall ſee theſe are the very ſame
to a tittle, they made their boaſt of their Jewſhip and law: it is no new
thing for formal profeſſors to make their external profeſſions a
ſan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctuary in their own conceit, to ſhelter them from all evil: O horrid
miſtake! God hath power to make the beſt of men baſe and contemptible, if
they live not up to their near relation to God, notwithſtanding any ſeeming
priviledge to the contrary; So much for the <hi>potter</hi> and

ſets out the Jews imbaſed condition; now by ſin they were become clay;
time was when they were compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable to fine gold, <hi>Lam.</hi> 4.2. but by

ſome may ſay, hath not the goldſmith alſo power of his gold, to make

an honourable veſſel; and is the very caſe in that parallel place in
<hi>Jer.</hi> 18. where it is plain, that the ſame piece of clay that was
upon the wheel intended for a veſſel of honour, and breaking or marring,
the potter thereupon, makes it again <hi>another</hi> veſſel, as ſeemed

whoſe ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der mercies are over all his works, Pſal.</hi> 145. and that this
lump cannot refer to man in his Original, I ſhall offer five reaſons. 
<list>
                        <item>1. Becauſe in that Original making, there was made no
difference in veſſels, not then veſſels of honour and diſhonour, as
is plain, they were all made innocent and upright, and ſee what God himſelf
ſaith of what he had made of this lump, <hi>Gen.</hi> 1. <hi>laſt. he ſaw
every thing that he had made, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold it was good; abundantly,</hi> as the
hebrew reads, no defect in it, or in any thing, as was then made; to which
<hi>Solomon</hi> gives teſtimony, <hi>Eccle.</hi> 7. <hi>laſt, this one
thing have I found, that God made man up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>right, but</hi> he <hi>hath ſought
out many inventions:</hi> man in general conſidered, was made upright,
therefore <pb n="249" facs="tcp:107768:134"/>there were no veſſels of
diſhonour.</item>
                        <item> 2. If we ſtate this Original after the fall, and
then ſuppoſe God made the difference, it will not yet hold, becauſe
Jeſus Chriſt hath reſtored man into an equal capacity of being
veſſels of honour, for the plaiſter in Chriſt is as large as the ſore
in <hi>Adam,</hi> as appears clearly <hi>Rom.</hi> 5.18. <hi>as by the
diſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedience of one condemnation came upon all, ſo by the
righteouſneſſe of one the free gift came upon all men.</hi>
                        </item>
                        <item> 3. Becauſe if by a veſſel of diſhonour we mean
a ſinful man, as well as a miſerable man, then we ſhall make God the
author of ſin and diſobedience, which is far enough from God to do; he doth
not uſe to neceſſitate that which his ſoul abhorrs; the potter did not
deſignedly break the veſſel on pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe that he might make it a
diſhonourable veſſel, when it was more for his intereſt to make it a
veſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſel of honour. I remember what <hi>Ainſworth</hi> ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerves upon
<hi>Gen.</hi> 1. and <hi>laſt,</hi> this ſheweth (ſaith he) that ſin
and evil is not of God or by the work of his hands, but come in after by the
creature it ſelf falling from God: to which he cites the ſame place,
<hi>Eccleſ.</hi> 7.31. It is a known maxim, and a proverb, that God did not
make the devil nor a wicked man; it is true, he hath made or ordained wicked
men for puniſhment, as <hi>Solomon</hi> ſaith, God made man but not
ſinful man.</item>
                        <item> 4. Neither could our Apoſtle mean this Origi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal
making in <hi>Adam,</hi> in this text or context, for theſe three reaſons. 
<list>
                              <item>1. If ſo, it might well have ſilenced him as to
his blaming the Jews, when the defect lay in the root and Original.</item>
                              <item> 2. It had been altogether improper if this had
been ſo, to make ſo clear an appeal to <hi>Jer.</hi> 18. by 
<pb n="250" facs="tcp:107768:135"/>way of illuſtration, when we finde that the abi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing
<hi>Iſrael</hi> was the fruit of their actual diſobedience and rebellion
againſt God, as is plain in the former part of that propheſy.</item>
                              <item> 3. Beſides this the Apoſtle gives an exact
ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count why and how <hi>Iſrael</hi> came to miſſe of juſtifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation
and honour, which was becauſe <hi>they ſought it not by faith,</hi> but as
it were <hi>by the works of the law.</hi>

                        <item> 5. If God had deſignedly made veſſels of wrath,
then would he have taken pleaſure in filling them with wrath, which he doth
not: we have his ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemn oath to the contrary, <hi>Eze.</hi> 18. but of this

                  <q>Doctrine, 1. <hi>That God in his handling and dealing with
ſinful men is pleaſed to reſemble himſelf to a potter, a mean
tradeſman.</hi>
                  </q>
                  <p>God thought a potter and his clay and his pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedings

18. and would have <hi>Iere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miah</hi> ſtudy the metaphor, the proceedings of
the potter, to ſet forth his proceedings with <hi>Iſrael</hi> as they were
ſinful, degenerated from him, called marring in his hand, the Church in her
humble and low eſtate doth acknowledge God the <hi>potter,</hi> ſhe 
<pb n="251" facs="tcp:107768:135"/>the <hi>clay:</hi> I gave a threefold reaſon, why God
is ſtiled a <hi>potter</hi> and we the <hi>clay,</hi> which I would not have
forgotten. 
<list>
                        <item>1. From the meanneſs of the material that God works
in as well as the potter; the potter works in the loweſt materials, not in
gold or ſilver, braſs or iron, but earth.</item>
                        <item> 2. Becauſe, if the potter makes a very mean
veſſel of ſuch materials, it cannot take exception, or ſay, <hi>why
haſt thou made me thus?</hi> becauſe it was at beſt but clay.</item>
                        <item> 3. The potter doth make curious work, a rare and
excellent veſſel of clay, ſo doth God many times of great ſinners; he
makes of <hi>Saul</hi> a choice veſſel of honour, though of a perſecutor,
<hi>Act.</hi> 9.</item>

                  </p>
                  <p>2. From the Apoſtles taking ſuch pains to aſſert the
power and prerogative of God indefinitely, I note this ſecond doctrine.

walking in the ſteps of the faith of Abraham, Rom.</hi> 4.12. <hi>Gal.</hi>
3.19. <hi>if ye be Chriſts, then are you</hi> Abrahams <hi>ſeed:</hi> here
was the Jews miſtake, they thought God could not reject them as his ſeed
outward.</p>
                  <q>3. Doctrine, <hi>That ſin and diſobedience is of an

                  </q>
                  <p>This was the very caſe with this people to whom our

thoſe, <hi>Mat.</hi> 7. com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared with <hi>Luke</hi> 13. they were ſuch and
ſo diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>appointed.</p>
                  <q>5. Doctrine, <hi>That Gods rejecting, hardening and
reprobating men, rightly underſtood, is ſo equal, wiſe and juſt, that
it admits of no plea or acception by man.</hi>
                  </q>
                  <p>No more then for a potter to make a mean and contemptible
veſſel of a piece of clay that will not yeild and comply to the wheel, or
hard to be made for a higher uſe: who can in this caſe finde fault with the
potter? if indeed a goldſmith ſhould ſo <pb n="253" facs="tcp:107768:136"/>abaſe his
higher mettel of gold, to make a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temptible baſe veſſel, ſome might
have a mouth open to ſay, it is pitty ſuch a choice material ſhould be
ſo made, even ſo it might admit of ſome kinde of objection or finding
fault, if God ſhall make veſſels of wrath of innocent men, but it is far
from the judge of all the earth to do ſo.</p>
                  <q>6. Doctrine, <hi>That the power which God claims,</hi> which
anſwers to the potters power according to <hi>Ier.</hi> 18. <hi>is a power or
prerogative to harden, reject and reprobate, only for a courſe of actual

                  <p>When God is taking pains to make them ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nourable, and they

                  </p>

maintain, that God may very juſtly complain of ſuch. 
<list>
                  <item>1. Not only from his unqueſtionable and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>controulable
power and prerogative.</item>
                  <item> But 2ly, His equitable regulation of his power, in that he
hardens none but ſuch as firſt harden themſelves, or become clay, or
marred clay: he hardens none as men, nor as ſinners, ſimply con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidered,
but ſuch as have highly provoked him.</item>
                  <item> But 3ly, From his manner and method he takes in hardning,
which is by means more proper to ſoften then harden, namely, by
long-ſuffering and ſuffering, and conſequently with a ſufficiency of
means to keep them from further hardening and patience:</item>
               </list>he doth endure them with much long-alſo to mollifie and
ſoften them; that which anſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wers to the clay marring in the potters hand,
is the abuſe of Gods mercies, long-ſuffering and goodneſs; and as the
potter may without of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence or contradiction, from his clay, make that a
veſſel to diſhonour, who will not comply nor yield to the hand or wheel,
to be a veſſel of honour, ſo God may as inoffenſively and
unqueſtionably make thoſe perſons or people diſhonourable, who
deſpiſe and abuſe his patience and long-ſufferings towards them: from
the words the Apoſtle argues from the leſſer to the greater, if the
potter may do ſo to make of the ſame lump (theſe circumſtances
conſidered) one veſſel to honour, and another to diſhonour, the
lawfulneſs of which power none can queſtion, much more unqueſtionable and
ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parently equal and every way juſt, is that power <pb n="257" facs="tcp:107768:138"/>in
God which he exerciſeth in deſtroying terribly thoſe who ſhall abuſe
his great patience; ſo that it is very plain, that Gods great
long-ſuffering exerciſed over ſinners doth marvellouſly vindicate and
magnifie his juſtice and righteouſneſſe in their deſtruction: what
made <hi>Pharaohs</hi> ſignal and dread<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful deſtruction ſo
unqueſtionable but this, that God waited ſo long upon him, gave him ſo
many deliverances from judgements under all his reite<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated rebellions: from
this foot of account it is, that all men do vindicate Gods proceedings with his
circumciſed <hi>Iſrael</hi> firſt and laſt, that <hi>he had ſtretched
out his hand all the day long to them,</hi> Rom. 10.21. <hi>whileſt they were
a gainſaying people:</hi> God might have deſtroyed <hi>Pharaoh</hi> upon
his firſt act of rebellion, as he might alſo have dealt with <hi>Iſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rael;
but what if God willing to ſhew his wrath, and make his power known, endured
with much long-ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fering,</hi> as it is in our Text.</p>
            <p>This 22. <hi>verſe</hi> is another conſiderable paſſage to
reflect light upon the whole paſſage if it be well weighed and
conſidered, and doth undeniably of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer ſatisfaction to all that are
ingenious and wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling to be ſatisfyed in the controverſy; for in this
paſſage we may plainly perceive, that the Apoſtle in the whole doth not
deſigne in the leaſt to aſſert or maintain perſonal, peremptory and
abſolute re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>probation from eternity; for if he had ſo deſigned, the words
had more properly run thus; <hi>and what if God willing to ſhew and declare
his ſovereignty over men, was pleaſed from eternity abſolutely to
deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>min and decree, that the far greater number of man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kinde ſhould be
veſſels of wrath:</hi> (what is that to thee?) but from this context it is
plain, that God doth neither reprobate men as men, nor as ſinners, 
<pb n="258" facs="tcp:107768:139"/>ſimply conſidered, but as graceleſſe rebellious
ſinners, ſuch as have highly provoked God by a courſe of obſtinacy:
therefore the words runneth thus; <hi>And what if God willing to ſhew his
wrath, and make his power known, indured with much long<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuffering thoſe who
have made themſelves veſſels of wrath?</hi> yet God waits upon them who
are ſo ſited, in theſe verſes, as alſo in the whole context: the
Apoſtle hath a ſpeciall eye vpon <hi>Pharaoh;</hi> for there ſeems in
theſe words ſome anſwer to what we have, ver. 17. <hi>for this ſame

               </gap>ationall; they are the reddition
or application of the former compariſon of the potter, ver. 21. we know
commonly a parable conſiſts of two parts. 
<list>
                  <item>1. The parable or compariſon it ſelf.</item>
                  <item>2. The application,</item>
               </list> ſo as here; the Apoſtle hath formed a compariſon of a
<hi>potter</hi> in a proper fence conſidered, <hi>ver.</hi> 21. ſo here we
have the ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plication, as between the <hi>potter</hi> and his <hi>clay,</hi>
and his prerogative over it; ſo now he applys it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween God and rebellious
ſinners, and his power he may juſtly elaim over ſuch to deſtroy
them.</p>
            <p>And that which ſome object concerning the form of theſe words,
will not rationally contradict, but that theſe verſes are taken as an
application; that which is offered in contradiction is becauſe theſe
verſes are laid down interrogation-wiſe, <hi>what if;</hi> 
               <pb n="259" facs="tcp:107768:139"/>to which it may be replyed, that it is uſual ſo to
render the application of a parable, as appears, <hi>Mat.</hi> 6. <hi>Luke</hi>
12. <hi>Mat.</hi> 6.23. <hi>If thy eye be ſingle; If thy eye be evil,
Luke.</hi> 12. <hi>Luke</hi> 18. <hi>Shall not God avenge his own elect?</hi>
ſo that it is no ſtrange thing to finde the application of a parable
rendred inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rogation-wiſe; and as in that place it is rendred
argumentation-wiſe, from the leſſe to the greater, ſo here; as thus: if
the widdow by importunity obtained an act of juſtice from one that had it not
in himſelf, of one that feared not God, nor regar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded man, much more ſhall
the elect obtain of God who is naturally inclined to acts of juſtice and
mercy; thus muſt it be underſtood here: if the <hi>potter</hi> have power
to make a diſhonourable veſſel of the marred clay, God may much more
deſtroy thoſe terribly which withſtand his grace and abuſe his
long-ſuffering: all are not of opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion, that theſe verſes are the
application of <hi>ver.</hi> 21. but thoſe of cleareſt underſtanding in
this con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>text, are: and there are four Circumſtances conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derable to
confirm our belief, that theſe verſes are the application of
<hi>verſ.</hi> 21. 
<list>
                  <item>1. From the relative particle <hi>(and,)</hi> which is in
the Original, though not in all Tranſlations ſo engliſhed: and it is
taken notice of by ſome very Learned men, that the Tranſlators have not
dealt very fairly with us; an Engliſh word for it it will very well bear: and
two of our old Readings ſo expreſſe it, <hi>and what,</hi> or <hi>even
ſo what if God;</hi> ſo <hi>Tindall</hi> reades it: the Vulgar Latin
reades, <hi>and if God:</hi> all which readings do own theſe verſes is the
application.</item>
                  <item> 2. It is the judgement of moſt Interpreters that theſe
words are not perfect fence without bor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowing <pb n="260" facs="tcp:107768:140"/>ſome
ſupply ſomewhere elſe; there ſeems (ſay they) to be a defect in
ſpeech, for here are Queſtions propounded, <hi>what if God willing to do
ſo or ſo?</hi> but no anſwer given to them: but if we borrow theſe
words, <hi>ver.</hi> 21. <hi>hath he not power?</hi> and place them in the end
of theſe verſes, it will make the reading good fence: <hi>hath not the
potter power to do ſo and ſo?</hi> and <hi>what if God willing to ſhew
his wrath, and make his power known?</hi> hath he not power much more? Some
Learned men are ſo ſenſible of a defect in this caſe, that they fetch
ſupply from <hi>ver.</hi> 20. <hi>who art thou that replyeſt a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt
God? What if God willing to ſhew his power?</hi> but I think that neareſt
to us will do us the beſt ſervice.</item>
                  <item> 3. That which inclines me and others to think that theſe
verſes are a reddition or application to the compariſon, <hi>ver.</hi> 21.
is for theſe two Conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derations. 
<list>
                        <item>1. Becauſe there is nothing elſe delivered by the
Apoſtle in all the context that can be ſo proper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly anſwering to it as
theſe.</item>
                        <item> 2. It is not at all likely, that in a ſimilitude of
ſo great importance concerning the prerogative of God over his creatures, and
ſo liable to diverſe and various interpretations, and not to leave with it
its application; it is not uſual in matters of leſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſer concernment ſo
to do.</item>
                     </list>
                  </item>
                  <item> 4<hi>ly,</hi> That which may fully ſatisfie us of the
re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation of theſe verſes, is that ſweet harmony be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween them in the
ſubſtance of the matter: In the compariſon there are two ſorts of
veſſels: 
<list>
                        <item>1. <hi>Some to honour, and ſome to diſhonour,</hi>
in the power of the potter.</item>
                        <item>2. As the <hi>potter</hi> makes his diſhononrable
veſſels <pb n="261" facs="tcp:107768:140"/>of his marred clay, according to
<hi>Ier.</hi> 18. ſo God makes his of ſuch as deſpiſe and abuſe his
long<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuffering grace in his continued applications to them: theſe are
thoſe whom he claims a right to harden and reprobate, ſuch as have thereby
fitted and prepared themſelves for deſtruction, as <hi>Pha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raoh</hi> and
the Jews have done.</item>
                        <item>3. As the <hi>potter hath power of the ſame lump to
make honourable veſſels,</hi> ſo God will of all thoſe who comply with
his terms of grace in Chriſt, <hi>make them veſſels of honour whether
Iews or Gentiles;</hi>
                        </item>
                     </list> ſo that we may perceive, that theſe verſes are
gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven as an application of the compariſon, <hi>ver.</hi> 21. <hi>hath not
the potter?</hi> the great deſigne of the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle in theſe verſes is
to exalt and magnifie two great attributes of God. 
<list>
                        <item>1. His <hi>powerful wrath,</hi> or <hi>the power of his
wrath.</hi>
                        </item>
                        <item>2. The attribute of his <hi>enduring mercy,</hi>
                        </item>
                     </list> both which attributes of God the Apoſtle would have
the Jews to know, were magnified in the Goſpel-diſpenſation: there is a
revelation of both theſe, <hi>Rom.</hi> 1.18,19.</item>
               </list>but my principal work upon theſe <hi>verſes,</hi> will
be explication, wherein I ſhall enquire into theſe ſeven circumſtances.

anſwer God cannot properly be ſaid to be long-ſuffering, God cannot
ſuffer: it is only a borrowed word, and ſpoken to our underſtanding: it
is a word hard to be tranſlated into our language, therefore our old

<hi>long-ſuffering:</hi> as for in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance, the devils torments are
reſpited for a long time from his fall ſo many 1000 years: yet this
re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpite is no where ſtiled long-ſuffering, neither can it properly be
ſo ſaid, that God exerciſeth long-ſufferings to the devils; yet that
their torments are ſuſpended for a certain time is plain, from their words
to Jeſus Chriſt; art thou come to tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment us before the time? ſo in
<hi>Sauls</hi> caſe: the exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution of Gods judgment threatned upon
<hi>Saul</hi> is ſuſpended for a time, yet it is no where ſaid to be an
exerciſing long-ſuffering upon <hi>Saul:</hi> and the reaſon is,
becauſe as to theſe and ſuch like, Gods decrees of puniſhments were
abſolute and irrevo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kable, and ſo no repentance expected: whereas on the
other hand whereever there is inducing, waiting and long-ſuffering, and
expectation on Gods part, it doth ſatisfactorily teach, that ſuch perſons
are not under an abſolute decree of repro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bation as the devils are; yea, the
old world of whom S. <hi>Peter</hi> ſpeaks, 1 <hi>Peter</hi> 3.20. though
they had ſinned ſo greatly as they had, that <hi>it grieved God at the
heart, that ever he had made them;</hi> yet becauſe Gods reſolution as to
their deſtruction was but conditional, not abſolute, but like that of
<hi>Nineveh,</hi> it is therefore ſaid, that <hi>the long-ſuffering of God
waited or expected in the days of</hi> Noah: God expected repentance all that
120. years and offe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red them means accordingly by the miniſtry of
<hi>Noah;</hi> ſo it was with <hi>Pharaoh,</hi> though he was ſo bad, yet
ſo long as God afforded long-ſuffering to him, he expected repentance from
him, as appears <pb n="265" facs="tcp:107768:142"/>by the means he uſeth with him to the
laſt: ſo we may ſay of the Jews, of whom we are ſpeaking, they were in
and under the long ſufferings of God, and God expected repentance from them,
and blames them for not repenting and believing all the while: ſo that take
this for a ſure and infalli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble rule, that thoſe perſons or people
whoever they are, who are under the long-ſufferings of God, are not ſhut up
under an abſolute decree of reprobation, but repentance is required and
ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected from them: as ſee <hi>Rom.</hi> 2.4. the <hi>long-ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferings of
God leadeth to repentance:</hi> ſo 2 <hi>Peter</hi> 3.19. compared with
<hi>ver.</hi> 15. <hi>long-ſuffering to us<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward, not willing that any
ſhould periſh:</hi> the long-ſuffering of God is ſalvation, whereever
it is exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſed without exception, that is, the deſigne and tendancy; ſo
that thoſe <hi>veſſels of wrath fitted for doſtruction,</hi> are not
under an abſolute decree, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe under Gods long-ſufferings. It is
true, that through the baſeneſs of mens hearts, which is ſo ready to
abuſe this his long-ſuffering, they many times grow worſe under the
mercies of God, as <hi>Pharaoh</hi> did: to this <hi>Solomon</hi> ſpeaks,
<hi>Eccleſ.</hi> 8. <hi>be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe judgment is not ſpeedily executed
againſt an e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil doer, his heart is fully ſet in him to do evil:</hi>
wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed men (as one ſaith) deals with God, as birds do with a ſcarecrow,
afraid of it at firſt, and dare not come near it; but in time it not
ſtirring or mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving towards them, they grow bold, and will fly to it, and
ſit upon it; ſo by the long-ſufferings of God, wicked men grow hardened,
and worſe and worſe; ſo that the means appointed to repentance, through
the baſe heart of man, doth harden to deſtruction: ſo that Gods will of
<hi>ſhewing his wrath, and making his power known,</hi> in this place, muſt
be <pb n="266" facs="tcp:107768:143"/>underſtood only conditional, not abſolutely;
th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap> in caſe perſons are not
overcome by his long-ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferings, then this manifeſtation is to take place:
this was the very caſe with <hi>Pharaoh:</hi> if Gods rai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing him up ſo
often at his requeſt, did not humble him, and bring him to let his people go,
then <hi>be would make his power known in him:</hi> from hence it is plain,
that the Apoſtle in this place, is not treating abſolute perſonal
reprobation, but of a conditio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall and ſpecifical.</p>
               </div>
               <div type="subsection">
                  <p>The Sixth thing to be enquired into, is, about this
<hi>fitting</hi> and <hi>making up for deſtruction,</hi> with re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect to
the time of it, and the author of it: there are not a few who have drank in
that opinion, that this fitting is by God from the beginning, by an abſolute
and eternal decree of reprobation; but in the very conſiderate and deliberate
reading, the words will inlighten and inform us better, and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ways:
<hi>fitted,</hi> this word I finde but three times uſed in the whole
Scripture, that is 1 <hi>Kings</hi> 6.35. <hi>Proverbs</hi> 22.18. and in this
place; and in all theſe places it ſignifieth, deliberately to prepare, to
proportion, to finiſh, to compleat, and not at all to ordain or decree;
neither can the word be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood in that ſence: but that which I would
en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire after, is the author or operator in this fitting, by whom is this
fitting accompliſhed; it muſt be either of God or themſelves; I anſwer,
this fitting is not appropriated to God except accidentally and
ſubſequently, as God is ſaid to harden <hi>Pharaoh.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>1. The truth of this appears in the different reading of what
relates to the reprobate, and the elect in theſe two verſes: if God did in
any ſenſe <hi>prepare, or fit theſe veſſels of wrath to
deſtruction,</hi> as he prepares the veſſels of mercy to glory: why 
<pb n="267" facs="tcp:107768:143"/>ſhould the ſpirit of God render theſe two ſo
diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rently, appropriating the one unto God, and not the other, he doth not at
all intruſt God in the one, nor man in the other.</p>
                  <p>A Learned man doth well obſerve upon this place, that this
difference in reading doth import ſomething worthy our conſideration, and
this dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference is taken notice of as conſiderable, even by thoſe of the
Calviniſts opinion; one of them ſaith, they are fitted by God and
themſelves alſo; this a very antient Writer ſaith, on this place,
<hi>not</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>for Gods pleaſure, but his own deſert,
for</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>if they deſerved it not, his pleaſure would have
been to have ſaved them.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>2. It is plain, this fitting is not of God, becauſe Gods
applycations of long ſufferings is towards them, as ſuch ſo fitted, to be
a means of their re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducing from that ſtate of fitneſſe for deſtruction,
to a ſtate of preparedneſſe for glory; for it is un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deniably plain, that
this fitneſſe is not, as ſome would have it, the effect of Gods enduring
them, but they are ſaid to be fitted before God, who did thus endure them
with long-ſuffering: and it can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be properly ſaid, that God doth endure
them eſpecially with much-long ſuffering till they have firſt highly
provoked him by a voluntary courſe of actual rebellion, which doth prepare
perſons for deſtruction, as it did <hi>Pharaoh,</hi> who was fitted for
deſtruction after the firſt plague, much more af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter all the ſix plagus;
yet after this God waits under ſour plagues more: thus it is plain, that
perſons may be ſaid to be fitted for deſtruction, before God is ſaid to
endure them, ſo that all this endu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance as is exerciſed from the beginning
to the end of it, is upon ſuch as he may juſtly deſtroy the 
<pb n="268" facs="tcp:107768:144"/>firſt day of his applycations to them; ſo that it
can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be fairly gathered, that this fitting is wrought, much leſs ordained
or decreed by God, but by ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners themſelves: but againſt this it is
objected, that according to this notion men may be ſaid to make themſelves
veſſels of wrath or diſhonour, and how then doth it anſwer the terms of
the text, and the inſtance of the potter who is ſaid to make veſſels of
each ſort? I anſwer, that even in the fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>militude of the potter, it is
plain, that the pot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter doth not antecedently make veſſels of diſho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour,
but only ſubſequently, when they will not be otherways formed; as you have
largely heard from <hi>Ier.</hi> 18. it is marring of the clay that precedes
its being a veſſel of diſhonour; the potter deſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned it for honour:
ſo that man anticedently, and God ſubſequently makes veſſels of
diſhonour.</p>
                  <p>2. God is no where ſaid anticedently to make veſſels of
wrath, but much on the contrary, <hi>to make men upright, Gen.</hi> 1. <hi>God
made men very good, but they found out many inventious:</hi> it is true, there
is a way how God may be ſaid to make veſſels of wrath, that is, by making
a law or decree where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in he doth declare what ſort of ſinners ſhall be
veſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſels of wrath, and ſo they come judicially to be veſſels of
wrath: in this ſence muſt that ſaying be underſtood, <hi>Jude</hi> the
4th. certain men of old or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dained to this condemnation, ungodly men,
<hi>turning the grace of God into wantonneſſe;</hi> ſo that for God to
decree or ordain veſſels of wrath, without reſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect to quallifications,
doth not anſwer the pot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters power in the compariſon, nor other places of
Scripture: the potter doth not claim this power, to make veſſels of
diſhonour of the clay, becauſe it is his own goods, as men would
ſuppoſe in God, <pb n="269" facs="tcp:107768:144"/>but becauſe it is clay, and not
only ſo, but mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red clay, not meerly from his ſoveraignty or pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priety,
but from its vileneſſe; which liberty might be allowed the potter, if he
were a ſervant, and the clay none of his own: ſo that this fitting is to be
underſtood the voluntary act of the creature not of God; and theſe words
contains a declaration of Gods carriage towards thoſe whom he meets with,
fitted and prepared for deſtruction; he endu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

            <p>THeſe words ſeems to be a continued ſpeech tending to
vindicate the juſt and unqueſtion<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able power of God, not only to make
veſſels of <pb n="275" facs="tcp:107768:147"/>diſhonour ſubſequently, but much
more proper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and antecedently to make veſſels of honour and mercy; both
which anſwers to the power of the potter, in the compariſon before: as God
may juſtly on the one ſide make them veſſels of diſho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour who
withſtand his formation of them and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buſe long-ſuffering extended to
them, ſo he may much more make them <hi>veſſels of mercy,</hi> who
ſhall be found complying and tractable to his will, and ſo be prepared for
glory: the Apoſtle ſeems to lay great ſtreſſe upon this preparing and
fitting, as conſidered on both ſides, only here is an apparent difference,
he entruſts God in this latter not in the other; It is clearly appropriated
to God, to make veſſels of honour or mercy, but no ſuch ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plication to
the other: God is not unwilling to be accounted the authour of preparation for
glory: we have the Apoſtle in theſe words offering a ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond reaſon of
Gods enduring with ſuch long<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuffering the veſſels of wrath, that had
fitted them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves to be deſtroyed, not only that he might have the clearer
ground of advantage againſt them to ſhew his wrath, and make his power
known in their eminent and remarkable deſtruction, who ſhould ſo a baſe
his long-ſuffering.</p>
            <p>But 2. That by his ſo enduring he might make manifeſt and
declare by way of eminency his grace, love and mercy, upon them who ſhould be
prevailed upon by ſuch his mercy, to comply to his holy will: the Apoſtle
argues thus, if God ſhews ſuch mercy to his worſt and moſt provoking
enemies, much more to his obedient friends, <hi>Ioh.</hi> 15.14. <hi>ye are my
friends when you do whatſoever. I command you:</hi> Gods mercy exhibited to
the old world who were ſo wicked, <hi>that they had grieved 
<pb n="276" facs="tcp:107768:148"/>God to the very heart by their ſins,</hi> is a ground
to beget faith in Gods ſingular choice love and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect to his friend
righteous <hi>Noah,</hi> who had been ſingularly righteous before him in that
generati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; ſo Gods long-ſuffering to <hi>Pharaoh</hi> ſo ſpare him
ſo long, doth demonſtrate his fuller reſpect to <hi>Iſrael</hi> his
firſt-born, who were in <hi>Goſhen,</hi> where his plagues came not: that
ſingular favour ſhewn by the father to the prodigal, doth demonſtrate a
greater love to the elder ſon, that had not ſo done amiſs: therefore the
father tells him, <hi>he was al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways with him, and all that he had was
his:</hi> the pot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters taking pains with a crackt and marred veſſell (that
hath made it ſelf obnoxious to his will to be deſtroyed) to make it a
veſſel of honour, doth highly declare his very high eſtimation to that
veſſel, which is a veſſel of honour, more then if he had ground the
marred veſſel to pouder.</p>
            <p>So that to iſſue the matter in a few words, Gods great love to
ſinners demonſtrates his ſingular and choyce love to ſaints. Theſe
words are two ways underſtood. 
<list>
                  <item>One way is according to what I have declared as the
argument is drawn from <hi>Gods mercy</hi> to <hi>the veſſels of
wrath.</hi>
                  </item>
                  <item> 2. There are ſome, yea not a few who underſtand this
argument, to be drawn from the ſeverity of God to them, that he ſhews and
exerciſeth his wrath on them, that the <hi>riches of his glory may ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear to
the veſſels of mercy:</hi>
                  </item>
               </list> from thence ſome of them of that opinion, renders it in
theſe words, that <hi>Gods ſhewing his wrath,</hi> and <hi>making his power
known,</hi> in the dreadful deſtruction of reprobates, commends and ſets
off upon terms of far greater acceptance, the riches of his grace and love in
the <pb n="277" facs="tcp:107768:148"/>ſalvation of the elect; or thus, (as ſome ſay)
God making ſo many reprobates greatly advanceth his love to the elect; he
makes the reprobate drink the dregs of his wrath; that his mercy may be the
more ſweet to the elect: as two contraries ſets off each other the better:
but that this latter cannot be the ſence of our Apoſtle in this place, we
may be ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfied in the very reading the words: for if that o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinion were a
truth, yet it doth not appear from this context, that ſuch an opinion hath
any footing in it as may be eaſily ſeen: for here it is undenia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly plain,
that the argument is drawn from Gods mercy to the reprobate: the Apoſtle
ſeems to ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gue ſomething like this, <hi>chap.</hi> 5. <hi>if God had
ſuch love to enemies, as to give Chriſt for them:</hi> he ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gues, <hi>with
a much more as to thoſe reconciled, as to their ſalvation.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Here are couched in our text two reaſons, why God doth endure,
and not ſudainly cut off and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroy ſuch as have highly provoked him. 
<list>
                  <item>1. That in his ſo doing he may leave himſelf without
excuſe, and caſt all the blame upon the ſinner.</item>
                  <item>2. That from theſe his proceedings in ways of mercy to
ſuch ſo unworthy, he may offer a demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrative ground, how great his
glory ſhall be which he will ſhow and beſtow on thoſe who are bettered
by mercy. God did do ſomething for this end, that he might make known the
riches of his glory on the believer.</item>
               </list>
            </p>
            <p>But I ſhall briefly enquire into ſome words and
circumſtances in this text by way of explication, and ſo haſten to draw
up thoſe Doctrines which flow from theſe words ſo opened.

                  <p>I anſwer, there are two ways of making things known. 
<list>
                        <item>1. When they are brought to open and occular 
<pb n="280" facs="tcp:107768:150"/>view, to make a thing obvious; in this ſence the glory
of God can be no more ſeen then himſelf by man in a moral ſtate.</item>

diſcovered by arguments to be ſo to the underſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding;</item>
                     </list> and in this latter ſence it is moſt like, the
Apoſtle here intends: it is Gods deſigne to exhi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bite an argument or
<hi>Medium,</hi> by which men may be led to this knowledge of the <hi>riches of
Gods glory</hi> in himſelf, and in his diſtributions: God is not wanting in
his diſpenſations to men of ſufficiency of means of knowledge and
underſtanding, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by they may come to make an eſtimate in them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves,
how abundant rich in grace and bounty God is to them that obey him.</p>
               </div>
               <div type="subsection">
                  <p>4. Who are theſe veſſels of mercy, and why ſo called?
it is granted on all hands, that theſe veſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſels of mercy are ſuch as
once were miſerable, and of the ſame lump of thoſe who <hi>were dead in
ſins and treſpaſſes;</hi> according to <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 2. whilſt
they were walkers according to the courſe of this world, theſe have
obtained mercy: all which is compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hended in that word <hi>(called,)
verſe</hi> following, where theſe <hi>veſſels of mercy</hi> are ſo
deſcribed, <hi>even us whom he hath called: veſſels of mercy</hi> are
ſuch in their call, not in their decree.</p>
                  <p>2. Called <hi>veſſels</hi> by a metaphor, becauſe as
veſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſels properly called, have a particular form given them by the
artificer, who maketh and formeth them, to be commodious and fitted to receive
and hold things liquid and dry, which is put into them: ſo theſe are called
<hi>veſſels</hi> as they are formed and faſhioned by God by his word and
ſpirit; conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, regenerated perſons are as veſſels, they are the

uncapable to hold preſent mercy or future glory: <hi>veſſels of

                  <p>1. As we are in purſuance of the application of the
compariſon of the potter: I anſwer that the potter may in a more ſpecial
relation be ſaid to make veſſels of honour, becauſe he makes them
antecedently ſuch, but he makes veſſels of diſho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour but
ſubſequently, upon their marring; ſo thoſe that are Gods veſſels of

them, but the Scriptures doth not appropriate the making of veſſels of
wrath to God; we have an ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parent difference in reading: the veſſels of
wrath are ſaid to <hi>be fitted</hi> and <hi>prepared</hi> paſſively, or

                  <p>I remember one on this place ſaith, If God made veſſels
of wrath, he would take pleaſure to fill them with wrath, but that he is
unwilling to do: but why is God in ſpecial intereſted with making

calling: it is very plain, that theſe words are relative to the former
verſe, and calls us to look back to the former: ſome learned men takes
theſe words to be exegetical and explanatory of the former, ſhewing us how
God proceeds in making veſſels of mercy, namely by <hi>calling them:</hi>
the Apoſtle having been in the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer parts of this chapter, taking pains to
inform and convince the Jews, that God in his promiſe to <hi>Abraham,</hi>
did not intend the natural ſeed of <hi>Abraham,</hi> according to the
fleſh, he is now ſhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing them which way the ſeed comes in, namely, by
their being called, whether Jews or gentiles, not the Jews only, but alſo the
gentiles; not all the Jews, nor all the gentiles, but only the <hi>called</hi>
of both: I ſhall be very brief in handling this verſe, and alſo the
remaining part of the chapter, therefore I <pb n="289" facs="tcp:107768:154"/>ſhall
ſpeak a few words by way of explication, and in order thereunto it is
altogether needful to enquire what is meant by calling, <hi>(even us whom he
hath called;)</hi> calling is two ways underſtood in Scripture, 
<list>
                     <item>ſometimes it is taken in a large ſence for Gods
invitation and calling by the preaching of the Goſpel to the ear; this
calling is intended by Chriſt in the parable, <hi>Mat.</hi> 22.3. where we
reade, that Chriſt ſent forth his ſervants to call them that were bidden,
ſaying, come: to which agreeth the parable of the labourers alſo, the
ſend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing forth the Goſpel is this calling: now this cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling barely
conſidered, is common to thouſands that do not anſwer the call; who are
to no degree prepared for glory, but whilſt they are under this call are
preparing and fitting themſelves to be veſſels of wrath: whilſt they
refuſe to come: of ſuch a ſort our Lord ſpeaks; <hi>Mat.</hi> 26.16.
<hi>chap.</hi> 22.14. <hi>many are called but few choſen.</hi>
                     </item>
                     <item>2. <hi>Calling</hi> is underſtood in a more ſtrict
ſence in the Scripture, rather as the effect then the call it ſelf;
perſons are ſaid to be called when they are found anſwering the outward
call, by coming and complying by faith and obedience: thus <hi>calling</hi> is
generally underſtood in Scriptures, 1 <hi>Corin.</hi> 1.9. <hi>God is
faithful by whom we are called to the fellowſhip of his ſon: chap.</hi> 7.
is any called being circumciſed that is converted by faith and obedience to
the goſpel, <hi>vers.</hi> 21. 22. <hi>Gal.</hi> 1.6. <hi>called you unto the
grace of Chriſt, vers.</hi> 15. <hi>but when it pleaſed the Lord to call me
by his grace:</hi>
                     </item>
                  </list>theſe and many other places ſpeaks of calling as
anſwered unto; and in this ſence our text is to be underſtood of an
effectu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all call, becauſe this call is a demonſtration of <hi>veſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſels
of mercy,</hi> ſo that calling according to our text <pb n="290" facs="tcp:107768:155"/>is
comprehenſive of repentance, faith and obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, the whole new
creature.</p>
               <p>But 2<hi>ly,</hi> Why doth our Apoſtle ſubjoin theſe words
to the former <hi>vers.</hi> 23. as with reſpect to the <hi>veſſels of
mercy?</hi> I anſwer the Apoſtle in this con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nexion and explanation is
inſinuating to the Jews the way how perſons comes to be <hi>veſſels of
wrath</hi> and <hi>veſſels of mercy; veſſels of wrath,</hi> by

though we know the complyance of the creature is as abſolutely neceſſary
in order to bring forth this effect of pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paredneſs for glory?</p>
               <p>I anſwer, it may well both here and elſewhere be aſcribed
unto God.

it may well be appropriated to God.</item>
                     <item> 2. God is not only the firſt but the cordial,
im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunate ſeeker and caller, he is unwearied in his calling; he calls
again and again; how doth the truth of this appear in that parable?
<hi>Mat.</hi> 22. <pb n="291" facs="tcp:107768:155"/>
                        <hi>he ſends again and again,</hi>
and that with argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,</item>
                     <item> 3. It may well be appropriated to God, that we are
called, becauſe he gives ears to bear, and legs to come, to anſwer his
call: the abilities of the creature is every way of God.</item>
                  </list>
               </p>
               <p>Theſe things conſidered, it may well be aſcribed to God
the caller, not our ſelves: but why have we this particle (<hi>even</hi> or
<hi>alſo</hi>)? this <hi>alſo</hi> is to be underſtood emphatically, as
taking ſpecial and ſingular notice of Gods ſpecial mercy and grace in
this act of his calling, it doth marvellouſly demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrate the
condeſcending grace of God; this alſo is often uſed emphatically in other
places, as 1 <hi>Theſ.</hi> 4.8. <hi>who alſo hath given us his
ſpirit:</hi> we have it four times emphatically uſed, <hi>Rom.</hi>
8.30,34. why have we this diſtributive ſpeech added? <hi>not of the Jews
only, but alſo of the Gentiles;</hi> it is the ſaying of a learned man upon
this word, we are to take notice that commonly when in Scriptures we finde
things affirmed, it ſuppoſeth, that there are ſome that deny thoſe
things, and when things in Scripture are denied, it ſuppoſeth ſome body
affirming them: ſo the reaſon of this kinde of ſpeaking here, <hi>not the
Jews only, but alſo of the Gentiles,</hi> was becauſe he knew very well,
that the unbelieving and ſelf-opinionated Jews, were inclined to think, that
if any people under heaven were priviledged with the choiceſt favour of God,
they muſt be them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, if not only yet chiefly: now to take off this
their opinion, the Apoſtle adds theſe words, <hi>not the Jews only:</hi>
God hath by his goſpel diſpenſation pulled down the wall of ſeperation
and partition, and made his goſpel-priviledges level to Jews and gentiles: he
hath made no difference between Jews <pb n="292" facs="tcp:107768:156"/>and gentiles, having
purified the gentiles hearts by faith, <hi>Act.</hi> 15. therefore our Lord in
his para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble ſends into the high-ways, to the poor gentiles that had no
riches to truſt unto. So that we may perceive that the Apoſtle in this
verſe, is labour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to ſatisfy the Jews, who were like to be offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded at
his appropriating to himſelf, and thoſe who had received his doctrine, the
dignity of being veſſels of mercy, who but a little before were in their
condition: the Apoſtle gives them to know that this change was made by Gods
calling ſome of each of them, <hi>both Jew and gentile.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Thus much for explication of theſe words, now that which
remains, is to lay before you thoſe ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary concluſions that
preſent themſelves unto us from theſe words, which are theſe that
follow.</p>

perſons who are veſſels of mercy, and prepared for glory, are ſuch who

<list>
                     <item>1. We have quotations tending to ratify and confirm what
the Apoſtle <hi>Paul</hi> had inſinuated (at leaſt implicitly),
concerning the admiſſion of the gentiles, upon believing in Jeſus
Chriſt, <hi>to be the true ſeed of Abraham and heirs of promiſe:</hi> and
that this was no new nor ſtrange thing, but what their own prophets had
foreſeen and fore told ſhould be accompliſhed, either as to the gentiles,
or ſuch a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

forlorn and rejected ſtate: this we have <hi>verſe</hi> 25, 26.</item>
                     <item> The ſecond head ſpeaks thus much, that God by vertue
of his promiſe to <hi>Abraham</hi> and his ſeed, was not obliged to
entertain in his favour, all or the greater number of <hi>Abrahams</hi> natural
or fede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral ſeed, but the greateſt part, nay all except a very few, a
ſmall remnant, have been liable to rejection for ſin, yea even in former
times: this we have <hi>verſe</hi> 27, 28, 29.</item>
                     <item> 3. Under the third head we have the Apoſtle ſumming
up in a few words what he had been in <pb n="296" facs="tcp:107768:158"/>chief treating upon
in this chapter, as to the way purpoſed and determined by God, in which men
may obtain juſtification: this we have <hi>verſe</hi> 30, 31, 32. in which
we have an epitomy or abridgement of the whole controverſie; from whence we
may eaſily gather, what was the matter he had been running at in this
chapter, becauſe <hi>they ſought it not by faith, but as it were by the
works of the law.</hi>
                     </item>
                     <item> Under the fourth head we have not only the more general
and remote ground of this dreadful miſcarriage of the Jews, but the very
particular and immediate ground of it, they ſtumbled at that ſtumbling
ſtone, that is, at Jeſus Chriſt his ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcurity and mean appearance in
the world; this occaſioned the Jews to be offended: Of theſe four heads I

                     </item>
                  </list> Thus we may perceive that the prophet had a clear and
diſtinct proſpect of a great change of eſtate as to ſome people, but it
is not expreſt <hi>who;</hi> there are ſome different apprehenſions
amongſt expoſitors a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout this paſſage.</p>
               <p>There are three opinions upon theſe words. 
<list>
                     <item>1. Some are of opinion that theſe predictions relate to
the Jews only as to their return from their captivated ſtate, wherein they
appeared, as if they were not the people of God, but caſt off by him, that
yet there ſhould be a time again when they ſhould have the face and favour
of God, and by him be owned for his people: and the truth is, the context
<hi>Hoſea</hi> 1.2. doth run much that way as to them, which makes
<hi>Calvin</hi> very confident of that ſide, as if he thought none could
contradict him.</item>
                     <item> But 2<hi>ly,</hi> There are many others that are of
opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion, that theſe words are a prophetical predicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the <hi>calling
of the gentiles,</hi> becauſe they are ſaid to be <hi>a nation not beloved,
a people, not the people of God;</hi> and thoſe appellations are commonly
ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plyed to the gentiles in Scripture; and alſo becauſe the Apoſtle doth
cite this ſaying in this place fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing, what he had ſaid
<hi>verſe</hi> 24. as a relative to thoſe he there ſpeaks of <hi>called,
not of the Jews only but alſo of the gentiles;</hi> of this opinion is
<hi>Pereus,</hi> with much confidence.</item>
                     <item> But there are a third ſort, who judge theſe words of
God by <hi>Hoſea,</hi> doth relate to both Jews <pb n="298" facs="tcp:107768:159"/>and
gentiles, and are fulfilled in both Jews and gentiles; that they are both
couched in theſe words; and I think they may well anſwer to both, not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
to the Jews in their return out of <hi>captivity,</hi> but they will well
anſwer to the acceptance and ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion of the gentiles to the grace and
favour of the Goſpel:</item>
                  </list>and ſo the Apoſtle <hi>Peter</hi> ſeems to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply it
chiefly to the gentiles, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2.9. <hi>which i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     <desc>•…</desc>
                  </gap> they admit of ſeveral ſulfillings; <hi>ſo might
this be fulfilled to the Jews and alſo to the gentiles:</hi> and ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral
others: for inſtance, that prophecy of <hi>calling Gods ſon out of
Egypt,</hi> is ſeveral times fulfilled, once it is fulfilled in Chriſt, as
<hi>Mat.</hi> 2.15. ſo that <hi>Ier.</hi> 31. of <hi>Rachels weeping for her
children that were not:</hi> this hath ahd two fulfillings already: ſo that
<hi>Pſal.</hi> 41. <hi>John</hi> 13.18. ſo that the prophets might it the
firſt place intend the Jews, and afterward it might relate to the gentiles
alſo; but take it either way, as relating to the Jews or gentiles, it doth
accommodate the Apoſtle in his deſigne: for if the Jews after they had been
rejected from being a people; may be reſtored and accepted, why may not the
gentiles alſo, ſeeing they are both in the ſame condition: it may be
ſuppoſed, that it was not the chief deſigne of the Apoſtle in this
place to prove or declare either the re-inſtating of the Jews into the favour
of God after that cloud of diſplea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fure which for a time had been ſpread
upon them, the calling the gentiles to be a people, but rather to ſatisfy the
Jews it was no new orſtrange thing, or that which might give them occaſion
to quarr<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1+ letters">
                     <desc>•…</desc>
                  </gap> with him, for
aſſerting, that a people now alienated from God, may be called, and
anſwering his call <pb n="299" facs="tcp:107768:159"/>may be received into favour with him
as his peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple; for the Jews and gentiles were both laid le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vel, and were all
under ſin, as he ſaith <hi>Rom.</hi> 3.9. what are the Jews better then the
gentiles? we have proved (ſaith the Apoſtle) <hi>that all are under
ſin,</hi> and God makes veſſels of mercy both of Jews and gentiles, and
this (ſaith the Apoſtle) is no more then your own prophets do aſſert;
<hi>he will call them his people that were not his people:</hi> ſo that the
great deſigne of our Apoſtle in theſe quotations out of <hi>Hoſea,</hi>
was to convince the Jews that his do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine was no new doctrine, that perſons
out of co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant, love, and favour, as the gentiles were, might
notwithſtanding be admitted: it may be taken notice of, that in our
Apoſtles quotations of theſe Prophets, there are ſome verbal variations
between the Old and New Teſtament; and this very uſual with the penmen of
the New Teſtament, when they cite the Old. But this know, that when it is
ſo, it is neither negligently nor ignorantly, but deſignedly, to
accommodate the ſence, and ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the Text more lightſome: yet the
difference here, is but ſmall, not material, as we may ſee, if we compare
<hi>Hoſea.</hi> 2.23. the Apoſtle inſtead of <hi>mercy,</hi> renders it
<hi>love,</hi> which is more lightſome and Goſpel: for <hi>mercy</hi> may
be where <hi>love</hi> is not: ſo when the Old reade <hi>ſons,</hi> the New
reade <hi>chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren;</hi> which is ſtill more evangelical: as to theſe
words I would ſpeak to them with reſpect to the authour, and the words
themſelves. 
<list>
                     <item>1. It is plain, that God is the ſpeaker, it is God the
Apoſtle intends, when he uſeth theſe words, for he ſaith alſo in
<hi>Hoſea, I will call them my people:</hi> Gods words and the Prophets words
are the ſame: what the Prophet ſpeaks, God is ſaid to ſpeak.</item>

10. the Apoſtle in maintaining his grand doctrine of juſtification by faith
alone, doth in the Jews apprehenſions introduce two nations, which were hard
for them to digeſt, which was theſe. 
<list>
                  <item>1. That by that his doctrine as well gentiles as Jews may
become the people of God, that is to ſay, upon believing.</item>
                  <item> 
                     <pb n="306" facs="tcp:107768:163"/>2. From this his doctrine follows,
that far the greater number of the natural ſeed of <hi>Abraham,</hi> the
Jews, who reject and abhor this doctrine of <hi>faith,</hi> muſt
neceſſarily be rejected, and caſt off by God, from being his
people.</item>
               </list> Now the Apoſtle by conceſſion doth allow both theſe
nations to be tru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and naturally deduced from the premiſes, and therefore
doth bring the Teſtimonies of their own prophets, <hi>Hoſea</hi> and
<hi>Eſaiah,</hi> to confirm the ſame.</p>
            <p>The firſt of theſe teſtimonies we have conſidered already;
we now proceed to the ſecond teſtimony to confirm the Apoſtles notion,
that <hi>not all</hi> nor the greateſt number of the ſeed of
<hi>Abraham</hi> ſhall be ſaved, but on the contrary, a very ſmall
remnant, according, to the teſtimony of that royal Prophet <hi>Eſaiah,
chap.</hi> 10.22,23. <hi>chap.</hi> 1.9. As to the firſt teſtimony we may
divide the matter into two parts. 
<list>
                  <item>1. The teſtimony it ſelf.</item>
                  <item> 2. The amplification of it.</item>
               </list> 
               <list>
                  <item>1. The teſtimony it ſelf is this; that of the
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>aſt and innumerable body of the
Jews that went into the Babiloniſh captivity, though their numbers were as
the ſand on the ſea, yet but a ſmall number ſhould return out of it to
re-enjoy their own land; a remnant is taken for a very ſmall part, in
com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pariſon of the whole piece; and we may take no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice, that this prophet
<hi>Eſaiah</hi> looked forwards alſo in this his propheſy, even to
goſpel-days, and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">
                        <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                     </gap> their
laſt eſtate is alſo taken in by him: for the Apoſtle cites this place
of <hi>Eſaiah,</hi> to ſure with his preſent deſign, and the Jews
preſent caſe, which appears plain enough, by the manner of the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles 
<pb n="307" facs="tcp:107768:163"/>expreſſing this return, by the word <hi>ſaved, a
remnant ſhall be ſaved.</hi>
                     <p>2. The truth hereof appears from the Prophets amplification
of this return, <hi>Eſa.</hi> 10.21,22. <hi>they upon their return ſhall
ſtay upon God,</hi> in truth they ſhall return to the mighty God; which
return ſome learned interpreters expound of <hi>Converſion.</hi>
                     </p>
                  </item>
                  <item> 2. We have the Apoſtles amplification of this
teſtimony in four circumſtances. 
<list>
                        <item>1. The author, the Apoſtle doth not deliver this from
himſelf, but he gives the Jews their own Prophets teſtimony; if he had
given this of himſelf, he knew it would not ſo readily have been recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
by them, but <hi>Eſaiah</hi> was a Prophet, againſt whom they could not
object.</item>
                        <item> 2. In this amplification, it is conſiderable, the
manner of the prophets delivering this teſtimony, as our Apoſtle hath it
here, <hi>he cryeth;</hi> ſhewing ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther his grief and ſorrow for them, or
pathetical deſire that his prophecy might be beeded and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>garded by them:
and there ſeems to be an empha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſis, in the Apoſtles thus delivering
himſelf, as if he ſhould ſay, <hi>are you angry with me for implicitly
whiſpering?</hi> that but a few or ſmall number of you Jews, the natural
ſeed of <hi>Abraham,</hi> ſhall be ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, when your own prophet
<hi>Iſaiah</hi> cryed it out, and proclaimed it with a loud voice in the ears
of your forefathers, when time was.</item>
                        <item> 3. In this amplification we have the Apoſtles
ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument; as to the number of the children of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> they were
<hi>as the ſand on the ſea,</hi> therefore the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the more to be

            <p>WE now proceed to the third head pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounded to be handled in
order to a brief concluſion of this chapter, which contains the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent
ſtate of the Jews and gentiles: we have the Apoſtle in theſe 2. verſes
drawing up his reſult as the ſum and ſubſtance of what he had been
treating about in this chapter, as to the right way and means appointed by God,
in order to juſtification and ſalvation, only by faith: this particle
<hi>(then), what ſhall we ſay then?</hi> doth undeniably ſerve to
demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrate, <pb n="317" facs="tcp:107768:168"/>that theſe words are relative to the
former matter in this chapter; and if you would be ſatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied what has been
the Apoſtles precedent theme in this Chapter, you may reade it in this
col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lection: it is the judgment of thoſe who would be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve, that the
Apoſtles theme in this chapter was about perſonal election and reprobation;
that this reſult is only drawn up from the two laſt teſtimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies out of
<hi>Hoſea</hi> and <hi>Eſaiah,</hi> which he had been treating upon: others
who are clear in their judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of the contrary, takes them to be the
reſult of what he had ſpoken unto in the whole precedent part of the
chapter and Epiſtle; and there is ſome good reaſon to be given, that
theſe words are the reſult of the whole rather then of what he had been
ſpeaking of from the prophets; it being plain, that theſe prophecies
ſpake nothing of juſtification which notwithſtanding is the Apoſtles
great do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine in this chapter and Epiſtle: our adverſaries being our
judges; they agree, that the great con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troverſie of the Apoſtle with the
Jews, was about the way or law of juſtification, whether by the works of the
law or faith in Chriſt; this is plain, if any ſhould deny it, <hi>cha.</hi>
3. <hi>cha.</hi> 4. <hi>cha.</hi> 10. of <hi>Romans:</hi> now if this was the
controverſie I appeal to all un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>biaſt ſouls, if this concluſion be not
very proper to fall in place here.</p>
            <p>But ſome may ſay, how doth it follow from the main body of
this chapter, that either the gentiles not following do attain, or the Jews
following doth not attain to righteouſneſs. I anſwer that both theſe
concluſions are in the bowels of the doctrine <hi>of juſtification by
faith, without the works of the law:</hi> as for inſtance,</p>
            <p>1. The gentiles who did believe were juſtified, 
<pb n="318" facs="tcp:107768:169"/>though they did not obſerve the Moſaical diſpen<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1+ letters">
                  <desc>•…</desc>
               </gap>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. 2. It is as plain, that the
Jews who did purſue will and run, in this diſpenſation, yet were not
juſtified, but rejected by God, both theſe are carried along in this
Epiſtle and chapter: their verſes cannot be the reſult of any other
doctrine but that of juſtification, much leſs can it be pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly the
reſult of that doctrin of perſonal election or reprobation: thoſe who are
willing to ſee the truth, may ſee as clearly as they may ſee the ſun
ſhine at noon day, that this concluſion cannot be drawn from ſuch
premiſſes, but may on the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary draw from them an impregnable argument,
that the Apoſtle had not been concerned about any ſuch doctrine of
election, but ſomething elſe: but ſoraſmuch as I muſt be brief
according to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe in the concluſion of this chapter, I ſhall come to
the words as they lie, <hi>what ſhall we ſay then?</hi> this kinde of
interrogatory ſpeaking is common with this Apoſtle on ſeveral other
places, as I have before ſpoken, <hi>ver.</hi> 14. this kinde of ſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
doth caſt a kinde of reflection back upon what he had been ſpeaking, as it
doth in other places, <hi>chap.</hi> 6.1. <hi>cha.</hi> 8.28. and other places:
that the whole world, is divided into Jews and gentiles: by gentiles here
muſt be underſtood all the whole uncircumciſed world, except ſuch as
were proſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lited to the Jews religion, that followed not after
righteouſneſs, that did not ſtear a courſe that way: but we are to
know, that in this kinde of ſpeaking there is more to be underſtood then is
expreſt: ſpoken or expreſt, it is not only to be underſtood in a
negative fence, that they were not juſt or righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous men, or that they did
not purſue or minde righteouſneſſe; or that they could not be charged 
<pb n="319" facs="tcp:107768:169"/>with unrighteouſneſſe, but affirmatively and
poſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tively, they walked according to the courſe of this world; in a
poſitive fence they lived in all wicked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe and all abomination,
<hi>Epheſ.</hi> 2. <hi>they were abo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minable, and to every good work
reprobate:</hi> for this adverb of <hi>denying,</hi> hath more in it then what
is ſpoken and expreſt; as I might ſhew you in ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral inſtances, 1
<hi>Cor.</hi> 10.5. <hi>with many of them God was not well-pleaſed,</hi> that
is, he was greatly diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleaſed and angry, <hi>Heb.</hi> 10.38. <hi>if any
draw back, my ſoul ſhall have no pleaſure in them</hi> (that is,) I
ſhall abhor them: ſo here, they followed not righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſſe, that
is, they were very far from righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſſe, they had nothing to pleade
as to accep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance; and by this kinde of ſpeaking concerning the gentiles the
Apoſtle doth anticipate the Jews, from making this an argument, that the
gentiles could not be gods people, from the conſideration of their
ſinfulneſſe; therefore S. <hi>Paul</hi> puts this in the front; <hi>they
followed not after righteouſneſſe; they attained:</hi> the word
ſignifieth to overtake, lay hold on righteouſneſſe, becauſe that this
righteouſneſſe came in by believing, not by working; for theſe gentiles
when righteouſneſſe and juſtification came to be preached to them by
the goſpel, ſoon laid hold upon, and embraced thoſe doctrines; the
gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiles <hi>received the word with joy, Act.</hi> 8. and that upon Gods own
terms, as a hungry man falls to his food: the gentiles had no righteouſneſs
of their own to relieve them, as the Jews had, therfore they accepted of the
righteouſneſſe of faith: goſpel-righteouſneſs is called the
<hi>righteouſneſſe of faith,</hi> becauſe men upon believing are
declared righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous; as it was with <hi>Abraham, he believed God; and it was
accounted to him for righteouſneſſe;</hi> as if <pb n="320" facs="tcp:107768:170"/>the
Apoſtle ſhould ſay to the Jews, I mean not ſuch a righteouſneſſe
as you ſpeak of or dream of, which conſiſts in the obſervation of the
law, but ſuch a righteouſneſſe as is according to Gods free grace; and
imputatively by believing, aecording to <hi>chap.</hi> 4.8. <hi>bleſſed is
the man to whom God will not impute ſin:</hi> the bleſſedneſſe is
not, that he hath no ſin, but that it is not imputed. Now when the Apoſtle
here ſaith, <hi>that the gentiles who followed not after
righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſſe, have attained to it:</hi> he muſt not be
un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood, to ſuppoſe or imply, in ſo ſaying, that this faith was
given them whilſt they flept, or that they attained without the exerciſe of
their inward abilityes; or that they were under an unavoidable neceſſity by
any decree to that purpoſe: but all that may be ſuppoſed to be intended
in this kinde of ſpeaking of the Apoſtle, may be reduced to theſe three
particulars, that when it was ſaid, <hi>they fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed not yet attained.</hi>

               <list>
                  <item>1. That God did graciouſly overlook or wink at their
former ignorance, &amp; notwithſtanding all their former idolatry and
prophaneſſe did ſend the goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpel &amp; the offers of grace &amp;
reconciliation amongſt them, when they did not think of it, or ſeek after
it.</item>
                  <item> 2. That theſe gentiles falling in with the goſpel in
the gracious invitations and tenders of it, upon Gods terms, and did actually
believe, they are accepted; and in reſpect to theſe two circumſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces,
it was propheſyed, <hi>Eſa.</hi> 65.1. and quoted <hi>Rom.</hi> 10. <hi>God
is found of them that ſought him not, and was made manifeſt to them that
asked not after him.</hi>
                  </item>
                  <item> 3. Theſe gentiles thus receiving and believing the
goſpel, <hi>God keepeth covenant and mercy,</hi> and ſo <hi>juſtifieth
and ſaveth them:</hi> thus it is to be under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood, that <hi>thoſe that
ſought not; yet attained,</hi> nor <pb n="321" facs="tcp:107768:170"/>can it be
underſtood otherways, notwithſtanding what hath been ſaid; but that
thoſe who do unfeig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nedly ſeek after God are in the moſt likely way to
finde him, for the promiſes run directly &amp; proper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to ſuch, 1
<hi>Chro.</hi> 28.9. <hi>Pr.</hi> 8.17. <hi>Eſ.</hi> 55. and where is any
promiſe made to thoſe that do not ſeek.</item>
               </list>
            </p>
            <p>2. Let not any of us think, that ſuch kinde of ſpeaking as
this, doth prove that perſons living un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the ſound of the goſpel from
day to day, and neglecting obedience thereunto, are not farther from attaining
every day then other.</p>
            <p>3. Neither doth this kinde of ſpeaking, prove, that God will be
ſavingly found of any perſons at any time, but when his heart is ingaged in
the uſe of thoſe means wherein he is to be found: now when the text
ſaith, <hi>he was found of them that ſought him not,</hi> It muſt be
underſtood, that God was mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving towards them, before they were mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
towards him; and hereupon they are drawn to ſeek God that never ſought him
before.</p>

the Jews endeavours after juſtification; that they did not attain though they
followed after: we have here a rational account in ſight not ſuppoſed but
expreſt. 
<list>
                  <item>1. <hi>They ſought it not by faith, but as it were by the

               </list> as the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtle begins this chapter with cordiall grief
and ſorrow for his contreymens diſappointment, ſo he concludes the
chapter with a rational account, how this came to paſs; this their ſad
eſtate was founded in their unbelief, and their unbelief was founded in their
being offended, and ſo ſtumbling at Chriſt as to his mean and low
poſition; he lay ſo low that they ſtumbled at him: the Apoſtle by this
kinde of concluſion, doth further amplify what the ſubject 
<pb n="327" facs="tcp:107768:173"/>was upon which he had been treating in this chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter; the
Apoſtle being to render a true reaſon of their diſappointment, doth not
in the leaſt ſuggeſt, much leſs aſſert in terms, that this their
preſent ſad eſtate was the effect of an eternal decree of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>probation,
upon a meer perſonal account, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out reſpect to their works, which had
been <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1+ letters">

               </gap>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry proper, if that had been
his theam in this chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, but it is plain and clear and above-board in this
concluſion; and that it might be ſatisfactory, he gives it negatively and
affirmatively, not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they were not elected are they not juſtified,
but <hi>becauſe they ſought it not by faith, but as it were by the works of
the law.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I ſhall enquire into the words as they lie by a brief
explication of them.</p>
            <p>1. Our apoſtle in this introduction ſuppoſeth <hi>ſome
body,</hi> from what he had ſaid lately to the Jews, as to their not
attaining, asking a queſtion to this effect, why or wherefore did they not
attain? this is ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed from this <hi>wherefore</hi> in the beginning;
now the anſwer to this queſtion, both negatively &amp; affirma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tively,
takes up the whole of theſe two verſes; theſe words <hi>they ſought
it,</hi> are not in the Original, but are a ſupplement from the former
verſe; yet they are a neceſſary ſupply to accommodate the ſence and
make it more clear, theſe words are alſo left out in the <hi>Vulgar
Latin:</hi> but why doth the Apoſtle add theſe words, <hi>(as it
were)?</hi> this kinde of ſpeaking ſuppoſeth ſome kinde of
reſemblance, though not the ſame thing, as the ſame kinde of ſpeaking
is underſtood, <hi>Cant.</hi> 6.12. <hi>as it were the company of two
armies,</hi> that is, it did ſeem like or bear ſome reſemblance to ſuch
an appearance: ſo <hi>Luke.</hi> 22.44. our Lord it is ſaid, <hi>ſweat as
it were <pb n="328" facs="tcp:107768:174"/>drops of bloud,</hi> in appearance it ſeemed
ſo, but there was water with it: ſo 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 4.9. 2 <hi>Cor.</hi>
11. Some think the Apoſtle ſpeaks this to impeach the Jews, as to their
imperfections in their obſervations of their own law, and that they did not
really and compleatly do thoſe works which that law requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, there was but
ſome reſemblance of their do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing them: their works being works of the devil
which they pretended were according to Gods law, <hi>John.</hi> 8. and ſo in
a ſtrict ſence very far from the works of the law: others think, he thus
ſpeaks to diſcover the miſtake in general of thoſe who think in the
leaſt to obtain juſtification by the ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervation of the law, if
ſtrictly obſerved, for at the beſt it was but as it were a way of
juſtification, and not the real way; for faith even in <hi>Abrahams</hi> time
was the way of juſtification: but if a ſecond Queſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on ſhould be asked
the Apoſtle, how comes it to paſſe that the Jews were ſo averſe to
believing in Chriſt? for it we have a ſecond anſwer, in the lat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter part
of theſe 32. and 33. verſes, <hi>they ſtumbled at the ſtumbling
ſtone,</hi> or as in the original, <hi>at the ſtone of the
ſtumbling;</hi> theſe two are rendred both with an Emphaſis, <hi>the
ſtone, the ſtumbling:</hi> they are both remarkable: by this
<hi>ſtone</hi> is underſtood Chriſt; I need not ſtand to prove, that he
is ſaid to be a tryed ſtone, a precious corner ſtone: now that this
<hi>ſtone</hi> ſhould be an occaſion of <hi>ſtumbling</hi> is
ſtrange: this <hi>ſtone</hi> was the moſt excellent of all ſtones, and
this <hi>ſtumbling</hi> the moſt ſignificant and moſt dangerous of all
ſtumblings: of this <hi>ſtone</hi> and of this <hi>ſtumbling</hi> our
Lord Chriſt ſpeaks, <hi>Mat.</hi> 21.44. <hi>they that fall by ſtumbling
at this ſtone, ſhall be broken: thoſe it falls upon, it ſhall grinde
them to powder:</hi> he that is ſo offended, and ſtumbles, ſo as not
firſt nor laſt <pb n="329" facs="tcp:107768:174"/>to believe in Chriſt ſhall utterly
be undone and ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ined, there can be no healing that wound: there was a fivefold
ground of offence by the Jews taken up againſt Chriſt.

<hi>Ioſeph</hi> who was a Carpenter was his Father; they would have had him

                  <item> 2. They were offended at the meanneſſe of Chriſts
perſon, he did not appear in pomp and glory, as they expected, and as he
ſhall appear the ſecond time: his garb was then mean and
deſpiſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble.</item>
                  <item> 3. At the meanneſſe and lowneſſe of his
educati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, he was not brought up in humane learning, arts or ſciences,
which occaſioned this queſtion of the Jews, <hi>Iohn.</hi> 7.15. <hi>how

diſciples and companions were but mean fiſher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, and ſuch like: the
rulers were not his fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowers, but ſilly people in the worlds
account.</item>
                  <item> 5. They were offended at the plainneſſe and
ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verity of his doctrine, he was bold in reproving ſin, eſpecially the
ſin of hypocricy, which they were ſo deeply guilty of: and this he did
without reſpect of perſons:</item>
               </list> now the reaſon why a man ſtumbles at a ſtone,
ſtick, or block in his way, is not always for want of light; men may
ſtumble at noon-day if they take not heed to their feet, if there be not a
careful circumſpect obſervation: the Jews <hi>ſtumbling,</hi> was not for
want of light, but diligent heeding their own prophets, which pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phecyed of
Chriſt in that way he came, as <hi>Iſa.</hi> 53. and others of them:
<hi>ſtumbling</hi> doth ſometimes ariſe from the thing it ſelf, &amp;
that from a twofold reaſon. <pb n="330" facs="tcp:107768:175"/> 
               <list>
                  <item>1. Sometimes becauſe it is laid ſo low, on the earth;
the Jews did ſtumble at Chriſt, by reaſon of his low poſition and
placing; he was in a low condition, he was poor and mean; the meanneſſe and
humillity of Chriſt put the Eunuch to a loſſe; he wanted ſome body to
guide him, <hi>Act.</hi> 8. after this ſence <hi>Iob</hi> is to be
underſtood, <hi>Iob.</hi> 27.2. he complains, <hi>that God had taken away his
judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,</hi> that is, that men could not judge him but to be an hypocrite,
ſo the Jews judged that Chriſt was ſmitten of God in his humilliation:
ſo that the low poſition of this <hi>ſtone</hi> is one reaſon of their
<hi>ſtumbling.</hi>

                  <item> 2. It is not only placed low on the earth, but in the very
way and path, even amongſt them, where they go; it was laid and pitcht in
<hi>Zion,</hi> which doth not always intend the literal place, the <hi>ſtrong
hold of Zion,</hi> but it is often ſpoken as to Gods people, they are often
called <hi>Zion,</hi> as <hi>Pſal.</hi> 69. <hi>Eſa.</hi> 49. this made the
Jews to undervalue Chriſt becauſe he was laid amongſt them, they knew him
and his ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginal, and that this did heighten their offence ſee <hi>Mat.</hi>
13.55.56. <hi>John.</hi> 6.42. <hi>ch.</hi> 7.27. and this <hi>ſtumbling</hi>
in this metaphor implyes the daſhing the foot againſt ſomething hard and
reſiſtive, whereby he receives much harm, is bruiſed and broke, and not
only ſo, but it occaſions a ſtop in their pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedings in that journy,
they can go no further, by reaſon thereof, they ſtumbled ſo at Chriſt
as to ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil and quarrel at him, as not being the true <hi>Meſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiah,</hi>
when indeed he was, and were mallicious and hateful to him, and ſo rejected
him, and were rejected by him. </item>

            <p>But ſome may ſay, may not God be concerned in this ſtumbling
of the Jews? doth not our text ſay, <pb n="331" facs="tcp:107768:175"/>that the <hi>Lord
God laid this ſtone there,</hi> even <hi>in Zion,</hi> and that <hi>as a
ſtumbling-ſtone and rock of offence?</hi> and doth not S. <hi>Peter</hi>
ſpeak to the ſame purpoſe 1 <hi>Peter,</hi> 2.8. <hi>They ſtumbled at
the word, being diſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedient, whereunto they were appointed:</hi> from which
text ſome gather a neceſſity for the Jews, to ſtum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, diſobey, and
reject Chriſt? to which I anſwer, that ſuch a conſtruction were not
only repugnant to the current of Scriptures but a great impeach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of Gods
juſtice and holineſſe, to make him the author of ſin and
diſobedience, ſo contrary to his nature, and abhorred by him: ſome
in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpreters mends this conſtruction by turning this word <hi>appointed</hi>
to the word <hi>diſpoſed,</hi> with an eye to themſelves not God: Dr.
<hi>Hammond</hi> reads the words thus, <hi>that thoſe that are diſobedient
to the goſpel and ſtand obſtinately againſt Chriſt, are thoſe who
are by God appointed and declared, to ſo ſtumble as to be ruined, by this
their obſtinacy:</hi> ſo that inſtead of Gods appointing the ſin
according to this conſtruction, he appoints the puniſhment of the ſin;
for diſobedience to the goſpel, is not to be imputed to the God of heaven,
but the God of this world: as 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 4. <hi>the God of this world
blindes the mindes of thoſe that believe not:</hi> our Lord Jeſus gives
this as the reaſon why they did not believe, <hi>becauſe they receive
honour one of another:</hi> but that God lays this ſtumbling-block in the
Jews way, according to our text, is plain, but for a far bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter end in God,
then for them to ſtumble at: their ſtumbling was accidental from the evil
of their own hearts, as the dunghil ſtinks becauſe the ſun ſhines upon
it; Chriſt is not antecedently or inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tially a ſtumbling-ſtone, but
accidentally and even<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tially, as Chriſt alſo ſaith, <hi>he came to make
diviſion <pb n="332" facs="tcp:107768:176"/>not peace, and to ſet the daughter againſt
the mother<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>.</hi> ſo Chriſt is
ſaid, <hi>Luke</hi> 2.34. <hi>to be ſet for the fall and riſing of many
in Iſrael;</hi> their fall accidentally, their riſing intentially; they
ſtumble at Chriſt out of ſtubborneſs and wilfulneſs, not for want of
light; this <hi>Calvin</hi> himſelf grants. It is added here in the
concluſion, <hi>ſhall not be aſhamed</hi> or <hi>confounded:</hi> I
before told you, that in theſe adverbs of deniall, the contrary is intended:
that is, <hi>he ſhall be bold,</hi> and <hi>ſhall glory;</hi> the reward of
believers being not only privative but poſitive; they ſhall not only be
delivered from ſhame but greatly glorified, <hi>Pro.</hi> 3. <hi>laſt,</hi>
theſe two are oppoſed one to the other, <hi>the wiſe ſhall inherit
glory, but ſhame ſhall be the promo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of fools.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I ſhall now only ſum up what doctrinal conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions theſe
two verſes thus opened doth afford us, and ſo cloſe the whole chapter: I
ſhall lay down ten doctrines.</p>
            <p>1. From the queſtion <hi>wherefore.</hi> 
               <q>1. Doct. <hi>That the notorious ſucceſleſneſs and
pal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable diſappointment to the Jews in their purſuing after
righteouſneſs, admits of a queſtion, wherefore, or why it is
ſo?</hi>
               </q>
            </p>
            <p>Here is a reaſon above-board, God is ready and his ſervants
ought to be ready, to render a reaſon of Gods ſeverity to ſinners.</p>
            <q>2. Doct. <hi>Perſons in a very fair and likely way to
ſalvation in their own thoughts, may ſuffer diſap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointment.</hi>
            </q>
            <p> 
               <q>3. Doct. <hi>The true reaſon of the Jews rejection and non
juſtification, was founded in their not believing in Jeſus
Chriſt:</hi>
               </q> this is the poſitive reaſon, and not their reprobation
from eternity; <hi>if you believe not in me, you ſhall die in your
ſins,</hi> ſaith Chriſt.</p>
            <q>
               <pb n="333" facs="tcp:107768:176"/>4. Doct. <hi>(As it were) The Jews were very
im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfect in the law by which they expected to be juſtifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed: their
obedience was but like, not the ſame.</hi>
            </q>
            <q>5. Doct. <hi>God hath in much wiſdome and counſel ſo
ordained and appointed the ſtate and ſtation of Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus Chriſt as to his
humiliatian, that if perſons be not very conſiderate and circumspect about
it, they may eaſily ſtumble at him (being ſo laid) to their utter ruine
and deſtruction.</hi>
            </q>
            <p>The caſe ſtands ſo with Chriſt and his ways, that if we
would be kept from ſtumbling, we muſt look narrowly into them: it is
eaſie to ſtumble at Chriſt and his ways, if not carefully heeded.</p>
            <q>6. Doct. <hi>(As it is written)</hi> S. <hi>Paul in his
preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings and writings had a ſpecial eye upon the Scripture
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap> before-written.</hi>
            </q>
            <p>This language is frequent with the Apoſtle, we have him a matter
of thirty times in his Epiſtles appealing to what is written, and ſixteen
times of them in this Epiſtle; the Apoſtle had a high valu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation of what
was written in the Scriptures of the prophets.</p>
            <q>7. Doct. (Behold,) <hi>That the poſition, ſetting or placing
of Chriſt by God, as to his humiliation, is a very remarkable
paſſage;</hi>
            </q>
            <p>It wants a <hi>behold</hi> to awaken perſons to take no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice of
it and conſider it before Chriſt came in the fleſh: ſee how careful the
ſpirit of God is to fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tell Chriſts humility before he came, eſpecially
this prophet <hi>Iſaiah,</hi> from whence this place is fetcht. 
<q>8. Doct. <hi>The Jews offence againſt Chriſt was heightened
by his being founded and laid amongſt themſelves.</hi>
               </q>
            </p>
            <p> 
               <q>9. Doct. <hi>(A rock of offence:) The ſame Jeſus Chriſt
which is a rock of defence to believers, is a rock <pb n="334" facs="tcp:107768:177"/>of
offence to unbelievers:</hi>
               </q> Believers make uſe of that in Chriſt for
their encouragement which unbelie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers apply for their ruine.</p>
            <p> 
               <q>10. Doct. <hi>Faith in Jeſus Chriſt doth beget pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence and
ſtabillity in waiting for glory and exaltati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on:</hi>
               </q> 
               <hi>Iſaiah</hi>
ſaith, <hi>they made not haſt,</hi> that is, thoſe who fear no
diſappointment: the Apoſtle turns it, <hi>not aſhamed, ſhall not have
cauſe of ſhame:</hi> they ſhall not be diſappointed, they ſhall not
be confounded ſhaken or ſhattered: Faith in Chriſt doth fix the
heart.</p>
            <p>Thus have I very briefly offered my judgement concerning the
Apoſtles ſcope in this chapter; and my deſire is that what I have offered
may be care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully examined, without prejudice and offence, and my deſire
alſo is; that the Lord may help your underſtandings to underſtand the
Scriptures, <hi>Amen.</hi>
